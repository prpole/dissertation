Sishin: cite on equation of human reproduction with other forms of labor

- cite on "While the author of Women and Economics (1898) devotes an entire chapter to the religion of her all-woman utopia, we are left to deduce what Herland's industry and political economy are like by piecing together clues scattered throughout the novel. This creates contradictions and ambiguities." - the problem of figuring out her economics (100)

- on the question of industrialization: The biggest ambiguity concerns the actual level of industrial development in Herland. (100)

- on electric cars and industrialization: "To produce them Herland would need an industrial base like the one that existed in the advanced capitalist world of 1915" (101)


Walcutt in "divided streams":

- "The elements of these contradictions...are contained in every piece of naturalistic writing. There is always the tension between hope and despair, between rebellion and apathy, between defying nature and submitting to it, between celebrating man's impulses and trying to educate them, between embracing the universe and regarding its dark abysses with terror." 17

- generally speaking this 1956 work could be evidence for my idea that the divisions within naturalism mirror the divisions within the Anthropocene...
