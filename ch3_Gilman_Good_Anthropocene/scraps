As one
might expect given the trend of integrating the built and natural
environments, there is not one single, sprawling urban center to
Herland, nor the corresponding separation of urban and rural divisions
of labor. Instead, there are small towns in what appears to be a loosely
unified political relationship---regions governed by local
“Over-Mothers”---a structure that benefits from easy transportation
between the cities.[@gilman_herland_2012 114, 151]

In contrast to wild spaces,
these spaces are reifications of perspectives on nature themselves,
visible in the way that interaction with the land occurs, and in this
case, in the way in which the land is shaped physically and narratively.

 Recasting
humans in the background of plants and animals puts a particular
importance on a punning reference to the “virgin” land, which takes on
not only the idea of an uncultivated space but defines the land by the
sexual virginity of parthenogenetic human women.[@gilman_herland_2012 85]

---a much more materialist, and even
historical-materialist, concern than a love scene at a fair.

. Indeed, the typical adventure narrative that leads
to that point appears to be a slightly tongue-in-cheek red herring:
brave, masculine explorers reconnoiter and infiltrate an unheard of
land, are captured and imprisoned, effect a daring escape---only to be
re-captured by laughing women who were a step ahead of them the whole
time. The adventure plot

 (in the form of the Herlander
Ellador, whom he marries, and who accompanies him back to our world)

that killed the free men
of the pre-Herland nation, the free women killing in turn all the
formerly enslaved men (though they do appear to have welcomed the
formerly enslaved women who remained to at least some extent)

In *Women and Economics*,
she argues that “change in the economic position of woman from
dependence to independence must bring with it a rearrangement of these
home interests and industries.”[@gilman_women_1966 224] Thus, she lays out a vision of
“apartments...without kitchens” except those “belonging to the house from
which meals could be served to the families in their rooms or in a
common dining-room” in larger domiciles, hoping thereby to liberate the
“hundreds of thousands of women in New York City alone who are
wage-earners, and who also have families.”

Though
a recent and relatively minor economic sub-field, ecological economics
will be essential to any economically focused vision of a good
Anthropocene.

And yet, texts included in
surveys of ecological economics do not usually predate the 1970s. It
took the twentieth century’s Great Acceleration to bring into focus the
necessity of an economics that could act as “a response to the pressing
environmental problems of the twentieth century” and explain, as
standard economics could not, “the unprecedented decline in
biodiversity, the changing climate, [and] increased generation of waste,
all caused by the pursuit of economic growth.”[@shmelev_ecological_2012 3-8] Like the
Anthropocene itself, however, ecological economics has a prehistory that
extends at least into the nineteenth century. John Bellamy Foster points
out that the roots of ecological economics can be found in strains of
early Marxian economics in which soil science and the study of
energetics, such as Sergei Podoloski in 1880 and, even earlier, Marx’s
own interest in the work of Justus von Liebig.[@foster_marxs_2000 166-7]

Objecting to the
cultural backgrounding of women’s domestic labor, she brought the sites
of their labor into the foreground---the precise opposite of what she
would do in *Herland*. But in both cases, economic and social change
begins with alteration of the physical environment.

Though the relationship of foreground to background is reversed, in
*Herland* Gilman’s thinking on kitchenless households combines with
her Wardian evolutionary theory to form a system in which the constant
transformations that define human inhabitation of space consciously feed
into a self- and environment-forming feedback loop. Domestic reform
easily becomes environmental reform because the country itself becomes
one big home. As Jeff, the eventual male Herlander, puts it in response
to Terry’s complaints that “There isn’t a home in the whole pitiful
place”: “There isn’t anything else [besides home], and you know it.”
Descriptions of the physical infrastructure contain many passages that
could be taken right from a kitchenless household pamphlet, as when Van
explains that for “food we either went to any convenient eating-house,
ordered a meal brought in, or took it with us to the woods, always and
equally good.”[@gilman_herland_2012 144] In this context, unlike in the more purely social
texts like *Women and Economics*, the ramifications of such a change are
not limited to a bounded realm of humanity. By bringing consumption into
the larger, self-sustaining system of Herland as a whole and making
cooking and eating a public activity, these communal eating-houses also
reduce material waste and make it possible to manage entirely the waste
that *is* produced. Centralization makes it possible to incorporate food
production into their “perfect scheme of refeeding the soil with all
that came out of it”: “All the scraps and leavings of their food, plant
waste from lumber work or textile industry, all the solid matter from
the sewage, properly treated and combined---everything which came from the
earth went back to it.”[@gilman_herland_2012 104] Herland’s communal kitchens would thus
fertilize the soil while eliminating the need for private domestic
labor, as such labor is incorporated into the ecology and the economy at
once.
