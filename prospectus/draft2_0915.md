title: Environmental Speculation - American Literary Naturalism and the Anthropocene
bibliography: prospectus.bib

### Outline: 

1. **Overview** - reading ALN as Anthropocene literature by rereading the
unexamined trend of environmental speculation. Def. environmental speculation

2. **Definition of terms** - def. ALN (before me (1) and how I respond (2)).
Understanding why naturalism is an important Anthropocene literature requires
a reexamination of this somewhat vexed genre. I will define American literary
naturalism (henceforth just "naturalism") as a movement active from 1890 to
1945 in the United States that traced the co-determination of human and natural
systems---both the ecological embeddedness of human systems and the influence
of human activity on natural systems---through a period during which the
human-nature relationship was undergoing a set of material and philosophical
revolutions. Naturalism examined these changes by using the individual as
a narrative focal points for historical, economic, and natural shifts that
extend beyond a single person, rather than taking individual subjectivities or
relationships among them as the narrative focus in its own right (as is the
case for naturalism's generic cousin, realism). My definition will necessarily
dispute or revise several hegemonic definitions of naturalism from [X year
- Y year]...

    A. Before me, three hegemonic defining factors: 
        i. determinism 
        ii. plot of decline 
        iii. Darwinism.
    B. Rebuttal: 
        i. is racist and environmental determinism should be supplanted by
ecological embeddedness. 
        ii. is overly formalist and inconsistent across the literature
        iii. Darwinism is merely one way among many that authors were grappling
with the place of the human in the natural and vice versa

3. **Theoretical Justification of project** - Chakrabarty and universalism;
reading the human *as species* in naturalism vs. Chak.; environmental
speculation as a way of representing ephemeral and distant ecological,
historical, economic changes

4. **Historical justification of project** - present the historical/anachronism
problem: literature of the Anthropocene is often defined by our consciousness
of anthropogenic climate change. Instead, we should look for the literature
that was attending to its causes when they began. ; periodizing with geological
time; outline changes in energy systems and economics using literary evidence

5. **Critical justification of project** - How has nobody seen this? 1.
Scholarly preoccupations - weirdly absent from ecocriticism and weirdly
non-ecocritical discourse in naturalist criticism; cli-fi, again, is
misconstrued as a contemporary genre

6. **Literary historical legacy** - but really, the stuff naturalism started
just took a drastically different form for most of the 20th century. The
scientific preoccupations of naturalism were transformed into science fiction
as the century continued. 
    A. Relationship of the two genres
    B. environmental speculation is a major SF strain that came about first in
naturalism; but the legacy blinds us to the origin
    C. I shall attend to these continuities in the organization and content of
the chapters, but primarily in my introduction and conclusion
    D. Readings of contemporary work will take a more distant view to outline
the trends and mainlines, while close reading will mostly be reserved for
naturalist texts.
