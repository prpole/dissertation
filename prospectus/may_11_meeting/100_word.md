My dissertation will trace what the "ecotopian imaginary," or the narrative
construction of spaces that lead to the creation of speculative social
ecologies, in American fiction of the long twentieth century. Ecotopian spaces
are marked by socioeconomic, ecological, and formal closure and attention to
energy throughput in human ecologies. Above all, ecotopian spaces articulate an
environmental perspective in resistance to a dominant ecological regime. This
project will discuss such spaces in Norris, Gilman, Cather, Chesnutt, Silko,
Henry Roth, and speculative fiction authors such as Kim Stanley Robinson and
Octavia Butler, uniting approaches from the Environmental Humanities and recent
Marxist theory.
