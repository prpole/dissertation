### Introduction: Ecotopia in General

My dissertation will trace what I am calling the "ecotopian imagination" in
American fiction of the long twentieth century. I define the ecotopian
imagination as the narrative construction of spaces that create speculative
social ecologies. Ecotopian spaces often share common characteristics: social,
economic, and ecological closure; an attention to energy throughput that
includes human actors; and responsiveness to a larger, contemporaneous
political or social regime or movement. They often also share formal features:
when they do not adhere to the traditional plot of the utopian novel, ecotopian
spaces tend to be sequestered in their own sections, and entrances and exits
from such spaces often have a transformative or wish-fulfilling effect on plot
and characters.  Above all, ecotopian spaces articulate an environmental (if
not always environmentalist) perspective through imagined material. Reading
such spaces can reveal an important spatial aspect to a given text's
imaginative capacities, but reading many of them historically can offer
something larger to environmentalism and the environmental humanities. An
implicit political argument underlies this project: that under conditions of
impending crisis, contemporary environmentalism needs a utopian imaginary, and
reading for ecotopian spaces can reveal material for this imaginary in
unexpected places.
