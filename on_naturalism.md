It is no coincidence that naturalism is simultaneously prone to ecological
thought and anti-capitalist, as both spring naturally from the desire to test
the limits of determinism and the human's place in its environment. Such
ecological determinism is not purely deterministic, after all, despite what the
universal "plot of decline" thesis might suggest. Rather, naturalism's
engagement with determinism forms a range of positions on the extent to which
the human animal and its creations (social or technological) are subject to
natural laws in the same way that other species' behaviors are. Capitalism, on
the other hand, is Promethean, taking as its very foundation the premise that
all things on its horizon can be mastered and monetized. (This is the
"Promethean" argument often, perhaps incorrectly, leveled at technology
itself.) Arguing that the human has not transcended natural laws both
underscores our ecological embeddedness and challenges the philosophical
foundations on which the capitalist economy is based.
