title: The Measureless Ranch of Vision: Frank Norris's Capitalocene Aesthetic
author: Phillip R. Polefrone
---

On Los Muertos Ranch, the primary setting of Frank Norris’s 1901 novel
*The Octopus*, the most important piece of machinery is not a thresher,
nor Magnus Derrick's industrial ploughs, nor indeed anything one might expect to see on
a farm at the turn of the twentieth century. Nor is the “machine in the
garden” of San Joaquin the railroad *per se*, even though the railroad
is the focus of Leo Marx’s original formulation of the term.[^1] It is,
in fact, a stock-ticker.

Installed by Magnus and his son Harran in the farm’s office, the ticker
sits alongside a detailed map of the ten-thousand-acre farm, a map not
only of elevation but of “the varying depths of the clays and loams in
the soil, accurately plotted”---an important document in a valley like the
San Joaquin, which was once a vast lakebed.[@nitta_tale_2012 444] Yet
what is most important to the Derricks is less the land of their own
farm than its connection to other similar plots of land, less their ten
thousand acres of wheat than the hundreds of millions of acres devoted
to the global wheat trade. Their displacement is embodied in the ticker itself:

Though pages earlier Harran Derrick worries over the wheat seed saved
from the last harvest, here it is the “flurry” of transactions in the
Chicago Pit that keeps him and his father up at night. Their fortunes
are based on the incalculable effects of actions in faraway markets,
making not just the farm but the individuals who run it mere elements in
a much larger whole. We can see the depth of their incorporation in the
sensory language with which these distant deals are transacted in the
minds of the ranchers: news “thrill[s]” into the offices, the ticker
itself is rendered haptically through its jerking motions (mirroring
their own emotional response), and the men seem almost to feel, on their
own ranch, the “effects of causes thousands of miles distant” in rains
and freezes and a “hot wind.” As the market becomes a vast system, a
network in which they are a node, the Derricks in turn become bigger
than themselves, their own sense of their capacities increased to the
scale of the network entire. As much as they are farmers, they have
become the commodities market embodied; and as much as the land is
farmed by the Derricks, it is farmed by impersonal market forces.

It must be asked what effect this state of affairs will have on the
physical transformations the farmers of the San Joaquin make to their
land through agriculture. If they attend more to the markets than to
their own farm, what will become of the soil to which markets are
indifferent? What are the material effects of thinking of individual
farms as an “agglomeration of wheat land the whole world round,” or in
other words, of globalization considered as an agricultural phenomenon?
If the Derricks lose track of their “individuality,” who is responsible
for the monoculture of wheat and its long-term consequences? For that
matter, who is really making the decisions here---the Derricks of Norris’s
*The Octopus*, or the Chicago financiers of its sequel, *The Pit*?
Or---perhaps more probably---does asking about individual actors miss the
point entirely in the face of a vast and overdetermined capitalist
system?

Asking “Who farms the wheat?” is an especially significant question in a
novel where wheat extends over the entire planet, as it does in the
imaginations of *The Octopus*’s protagonists, the ambitions of
commodities speculators, and, to a considerable extent, literally. What has to be grappled with is not only the wheat itself but the
planetary scale of capitalism’s environmental transformations. This set
of relations is best captured in the the term “Capitalocene” that many
have come to prefer to “Anthropocene.” Coined by Jason W. Moore, the
Capitalocene concept disputes the centrality of the “Anthropos,” the
human as a collective actor, in framing our planetary crisis, and places
responsibility instead with capitalism. The import of this distinction
is considerable. The mode of inquiry becomes historical as well as
scientific, a matter of a multifarious and shifting communities of
actants rather than the human considered as a unified population. The
Anthropocene framing is long on a sense of urgency but short on
historicity, Moore says, permitting its proponents to “not challenge the
naturalized inequalities, alienation, and violence inscribed in
modernity’s strategic relations of power and production...*at all”* in
their attempts to avert a crisis that remains, to them, purely
environmental.[@moore_capitalism_2015 170] Taking those
power-production relations as an object of critique extends the horizon
of political possibilities for the entire conversation. As Moore puts
it, shutting down a coal plant might slow global warming, but shutting
down the structures responsible for it can stop global warming for
good.[@moore_capitalism_2015 172] We might ask, with *The Octopus* in
mind, what the equivalent would be for wheat monocultures that both
stabilize the food supply and destabilize the world ecology by
decreasing biodiversity and creating the conditions of disease and soil
exhaustion, and how a Capitalocene reading of Norris’s *magnum opus*
changes the way we see its political critique.

The Capitalocene is a particularly apposite concept for understanding
*The Octopus*, so apposite that the inherent anachronism of introducing
it in the first nearly falls away. The novel insists on addressing systems rather
than people as the agents of environmental destruction---insists on 
confronting the impersonal market forces that drive agriculture and 
into which the Derricks are
subsumed. The novel presents the transactions between economic and natural
systems as a process of what Moore would call “co-determination” in ways
that go beyond what even Norris seems to have realized. And beneath this
conceptual resonance lies a more tangible historical basis in
the form of Joseph LeConte's “Psychozoic Era,” an anticipation of the 
Anthropocene that emphasizes the rule of mind and thus humanity's teleological 
organization of non-human life on the planet. LeConte was Norris's favorite
professor at Berkeley and an acknowledged intellectual influence in other realms,
but the relevance of the Psychozoic theory to *The Octopus* has so far escaped 
notice. Norris adapts this theory into something resembling the Capitalocene by 
combining it with an environmental critique of capitalism. He does so through what 
I will refer to as his Capitalocene aesthetic, a literary landscape aesthetic in
which descriptions of heavily modified landscapes make visible the logic
of the capitalist system that has transformed them. This aesthetic relies
on a paradox: Norris adopts the sublime and its diminution of agency, but 
he simultaneously invokes the sensation of a limitless
increase of individual agency through incorporation into a planet-spanning
system. This aesthetic tension makes visible the imaginative crisis of the 
Capitalocene. We are confronted with a post-nature, transformed by processes 
that exceed
the scale of the imagination, and yet we somehow still experience ourselves
as part of the system responsible. Under capitalism, the scale of our 
transformations exceed even our own imaginations. What terrifies us in this
form of the sublime is ourselves. 

This reading will implicitly address a rift that exists in Norris criticism
separating economic from natural-scientific readings of his works. 
The rift begins as early as 1963, when Donald Pizer's attempt to reconcile 
market-based and proto-ecocritical readings of the novel concludes 
by instead encouraging a critical "eclecticism" that would seem to discourage further such acts of synthesis.[^ln-pizer] As if in response, these 
threads have remained largely disparate since. Many critics have accepted 
the clear invitation to an economic reading of Norris’s work in the
gold-obsessions of *McTeague*, the affective responses to market panics in
*Vandover and the Brute* and *The Pit*, and of course, the monopolistic
freight-rate schemes of *The Octopus*.[^3] Others have followed the
lineage of Leo Marx into timelier ecocritical readings,
finding in Norris’s landscapes queer ecologies, in his settings a
landscape built on imperialism, and throughout his work a persistent
reference to animality.[^4] Recognizing the eco-centric critique
of capitalism in *The Octopus* will require a reconciliation of a 
different sort, one that is more dialectical than synthetic and that
recognizes the co-production of natural and human history. It will not
be a matter of naturalizing capitalism, but rather of attending to
the ways in which nature is capitalized.

The rest of this chapter will argue for a Capitalocene reading of *The
Octopus* and develop a theory of a Capitalocene aesthetic based on
Norris’s landscape descriptions. The case for the Capitalocene will be
made on both historical and thematic grounds, examining Norris’s
appropriation of Joseph LeConte’s Psychozoic theory for use in his own
environmental critique of capitalism. The aesthetic that erupts from
this proto-Capitalocene theory and into Norris’s literary landscapes is
based on an implicit critique of earlier aesthetics of nature. These
landscapes by turns adopt and subvert the Romantic aesthetics of the
sublime, the pastoral, and the picturesque, resulting in a paradox in
which the viewer is at once crushed by sublime terror and feels
themselves part of the forces that created the sublimity. The viewers
are imaginatively incapable of grasping the scale of capitalism’s
transformation of nature, but at the same time, feel their own
capacities for transformative action increased by integration into the
capitalist division of labor. After examining and theorizing this
aesthetic, the chapter will conclude with a brief discussion of areas
where similar hybrids of financial and agricultural themes arise in the
naturalist canon.

### The Case for a Capitalocene Reading of *The Octopus*

*The Octopus* obsessively returns to illustrations of natural and industrial
forces colliding and coupling. More often than not, these passages are
of the type extensively critiqued by ecofeminist critics: agriculture is
depicted, graphically, as a violent sexual encounter, in the long
Baconian tradition of conflating women’s bodies with nature to justify
the domination of both.[^5] As an endless line of ploughs rolls over the
San Joaquin’s wheat land, “the hundred iron hands kneaded and furrowed
and stroked the brown, humid earth, the hundred iron teeth bit deep into
the Titan’s flesh,” and as they “up-stirred the land, tens of thousands
of shears clutched deep into the warm, moist soil.” On one hand, Norris
seems to approve, calling it “the vast primal passion, the two
world-forces, the elemental Male and Female” and a “caress...for which
the Earth seemed panting.” But at the same time, this “primal passion”
is characterized by violence, of which he seems at least potentially
critical: it is a “rude advance, so robust as to be almost an assault,
so violent as to be veritably brutal.” It is a contradictory depiction
to its core, outlining “an infinite desire, at once terrible and divine,
knowing no law, untamed, savage, natural,
sublime.”[@moore_capitalism_2015 126-31]

Whatever it suggests to a modern reader about Norris’s sexual attitudes,
it also reveals a broader ambiguity in the novel’s representation of
agriculture as an industrial-natural assemblage. It is at once a rape
and, perversely, folded into the life of the planet, both a system of
extraction and a system of reproduction. This binary opposition,
rendered in terms of uncomplicated “Male and Female” gender roles,
suggests a reading of the scene in the Leo Marxian mode many critics of
*The Octopus* have adopted, as a conflict between images of the machine
and the garden.[^6] Elsewhere, however, and perhaps more
characteristically of the novel as a whole, this binarism breaks down,
and not in the idealized, symbolic reconciliation of the “middle
landscape.” In her terror when faced with the farm’s unnatural
sublimity, Annie Derrick has a vision of the struggle of humanity
against “nature,” but it is a struggle that is ultimately finished by
something else entirely, a terrifying and chimeric force with aspects of
both. Should humanity "strive to make head against the power of this nature,"

> at once it
> became relentless, a gigantic engine, a vast power, huge, terrible; a
> leviathan with a heart of steel, knowing no compunction, no
> forgiveness, no tolerance; crushing out the human atom with soundless
> calm, the agony of destruction sending never a jar, never a faintest
> tremour through all that prodigious mechanism of wheels and
> cogs.[@norris_octopus:_1986 180-1]

This is the same set of terms used to describe the railroad. The farm
becomes just the most local site of a much larger force that can only be
defined by breaking the natural-industrial, the natural-human binarism
of the sexualized ploughing. That ploughing *is* an assault on the
Earth, and it *is* part of planetary reproduction; both are so because
the constant assault has fundamentally transformed the processes of
reproduction into Annie Derrick’s unforgiving
leviathan, which can pass as "nature" until it is suddenly, terribly, machine.

The wheat, as vast as it is, can be taken as metonymic of the
larger system of relations that produce it---and hops, and corn, and
industrial-scale animal products---the system by which, historically,
“wheat frontiers remade the world only through extraordinary movements
of capital….aimed at transforming nature’s *work* into the bourgeoisie’s
*value*.”[@moore_capitalism_2015 71] The way that this nature-value
metabolism operates is less by a struggle with nature than a
transformation of it into a new force that embodies the hybrid of nature
and capital, which, elevated to a geological and planetary scale, form a
theory of the Capitalocene.

The a Capitalocene reading of *The Octopus* will be made in four
movements. First, I will make the historical case for introducing the term
Capitalocene, elaborating the connection between Norris’s
geological-planetary thinking and Joseph LeConte’s theory of the
Psychozoic Era. Next, the focus will shift to the abstract “forces” that
clash in Annie Derrick’s waking nightmare and throughout the novel---the
human, nature, and capitalism---showing that as an assemblage they form a new
world-ecological force, a dramatized figuration of
the Capitalocene. The third section will then return to the
question from the introduction, “Who farms the wheat?”, to show that
this new hybrid force is motivated by financial markets and operated
through the division of labor, a cyborg with the Chicago wheat pits as a
head and the farmers of the San Joaquin and beyond as its hands. The
final section will show how the logic of domestication established in
LeConte’s Psychozoic theory is extended from the plant and animal
kingdoms to labor, an evocative image of capitalism’s
exploitation-through-organization of human and non-human work at once.

*THE PSYCHOZOIC AND THE CAPITALOCENE*

In his time at Berkeley, Frank Norris was hardly a model student. No
doubt because he “hated study of the methodical sort and employed every
means to avoid it,” he was hopeless in math. Even in history, one of his
favorite subjects, he only gradually improved from near-failing grades
to a steady mediocrity. He distinguished himself more, apparently, as a
“paragon of true fraternity men,” as one of his brothers would reminisce
after his early death, and of course by the literary ambitions that
were beginning to bear fruit even then. There was at least one course of
study to which Norris was especially drawn, however, despite a lack of
inclination to the subject matter, and it was led by the well known
geologist Joseph LeConte. “Uncle Joe” LeConte was among Norris’s
favorite professors, and he took two of LeConte’s year-length courses,
geology and “Reproduction” (biology), between 1892 and
1893.[@crisler_frank_2014 103, @pizer_evolutionary_1961 553] In both
of these courses, but the first most notably for the topic at hand, he
encountered theories of the human and the extra-human that would guide
his work in *The Octopus*.

Joseph LeConte’s influence on Norris has been well documented in the
context of evolution,[^7] but it has an unexplored geological component:
in 1879, LeConte proposed a “Psychozoic Era.” Subtitled the “Age of
Man,” the Psychozoic theory arose out of the conviction that the “reigns
of *brute force* and *animal ferocity*” that had prevailed in “all
previous ages...was inconsistent with the supremacy of man.” He
therefore defines the new era not according to humanness *per se*, but
to the “*reign of mind*” that humanity represents. LeConte found this
reign of mind so significant as to constitute not only part of geologic
time, but its final act---the end of history, and not just human history:
“the history of the earth *finds its consummation, and its interpreter,
and its significance, in man*.”[@leconte_elements_1882 586-592,
emphasis in original] “Uncle Joe’s” own teaching materials strongly
suggest that Norris would have been exposed to this theory in his
1892-1893 geology course: LeConte included the Psychozoic Era in the two
successive geology textbooks he released in 1882 and 1886, at least one
of which was reissued in 1891, the year before Norris took his class.[@leconte_elements_1882, @leconte_compend_1886, @leconte_elements_1891]

The Psychozoic theory is sometimes mentioned as one of several theories
that anticipate the Anthropocene, alongside the Anthropozoic Era
proposed by Italian geologist Antonio Stoppani around 1873, and the
Noösphere of Vladimir Vernadsky and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in
1926.[^8] It is hard to say when the theory fell out of use, but by a quarter-century after LeConte’s death it was still in at least wide
enough circulation to warrant a dismissal in the journal *Science*. 
This dismissal itself is significant, in that its arguments against the Psychozoic are remarkably similar to those now marshalled against the Anthropocene. In 1926, E. W. Berry complained that

> a Psychozoic era is not only a false assumption, but altogether wrong
> in principle, and is really nurtured as a surviving or atavistic idea
> from the lower holocentric philosophy of the Middle Ages…. There can
> be no objection to speaking of the present as the Age of Man---or Woman,
> for that matter---but this is a quite different thing from setting up
> Psychozoic as a formal era. For this term possesses no qualifications,
> either with respect to the time involved, the sediments deposited or
> the distinctness of a lower boundary---either stratigraphic, faunal or
> floral.[@berry_term_1926 16]

Setting these complaints alongside a recent analysis of ongoing
critiques leveled at the Anthropocene, as catalogued and categorized by
Jan Zalasiewicz and his coauthors, the similarities are hard to miss.
Berry argues that the Psychozoic atavistically recenters the human; 
contemporary critics note that “it is anthropocentric to
suggest that we are special”. The temporal boundaries implied by the Psychozoic
are too narrow, just as the “temporal scales of the
Anthropocene are insignificant.” Berry did not find a distinct enough 
boundary in stratigraphy or otherwise for the Psychozoic, while some find 
the term "Anthropocene" insufficiently stratigraphic in its 
origins.[@zalasiewicz_making_2017 207, 210, 221] 
A common set of problems is a strange metric for comparison, but the
recursions across these two conversations are clear.

In comparison with the Anthropocene, however, the Psychozoic Era is at
once further reaching and qualitatively, if subtly, distinct. As a
periodization, it reaches well beyond the bounds of the
Anthropocene epoch in establishing a new era (in geologic time, eras
contain periods, and periods contain epochs). Rather than beginning with
the Great Acceleration of the twentieth century, it coincides in human
history with the Neolithic, a period beginning at around 10,000 B.C. and
marked by the invention of agriculture, the domestication of animals,
and the use of technologies such as pottery and stone-grinding. Herein
lies the qualitative difference: the Psychozoic's emphasis on the “mind,” implicit in
the choice of “Psycho-” over “Anthropo-” as a prefix, draws focus to the
capacities for organization, and through it, domination and
appropriation of plant and animal life. Domestication is the crucial
marker for LeConte's proposed era, and is made the defining feature of the
Neolithic in a chart from the 1986 edition of *Elements of Geology*:
![](media/image2.png)
What changes with the Neolithic is that the human started “organizing”
populations of other organisms, such that “the dangerous animals
decreased in size and number, and the useful animals and plants were
introduced, or else preserved by man.” The cataloguing and
taxonomization of organisms could also be taken as a natural extension of
this logic. In any case, it is the scale and nature of human
organization that defines LeConte’s epoch and unifies human history with
geological history.

Emphasizing organization as part of humanity’s domination and
transformation of the planet makes the Psychozoic Era particularly
friendly to integration with a theory of the Capitalocene. It does not
take the Anthropos as the driving force *per se*, though its
understanding of mind is undoubtedly anthropocentric; organization as a
focal point is not a far cry from management, the basis of economic
activity; and technology becomes central to both without being 
constitutive of either. The larger view of human and natural
history that drives Moore’s conception of the Capitalocene is based on
the premise that humans and environments “co-produce” each other, or in
other words, that “humans make environments and environments make
humans---and human organization.”[@moore_capitalism_2015 3] This is
true of human history beyond the ambit of capitalism, from the point
(perhaps the Neolithic) where humanity began increasing its capacities
to transform environments. In a certain sense, *all* moments in human
history can be defined by the ways in which they organize nature. The
difference, and the reason why capitalism rather than human history as a
whole defines Moore’s epochal term, is that the relations of production
that define capitalism rely on the constant revolutionization of
co-produced nature itself to yield “new and expanded sources of unpaid
work/energy.”[@moore_capitalism_2015 112] The system as a whole relies
on the accumulation-through-appropriation on a global scale of what
Moore calls “Cheap Nature,” defined by the “four cheaps” of labor-power,
food, energy, and raw materials.[@moore_capitalism_2015 17] Moore
takes 1450 as the Capitalocene’s starting point because that was when
accumulation through appropriation became the *raison d’être* of an
“epochal shift in the scale, speed, and scope of landscape
transformation in the Atlantic world and
beyond” as agricultural labor was freed for use elsewhere by the 
agricultural revolution of the low countries.[@moore_capitalism_2015 182] 
Capitalism is the point at which
a particular regime of organization takes hold that is different from
all others in both category and scale---because it categorically must
continue to increase its scale to maintain growth, and because it must
continually increase the efficiency of its exploitation to keep nature
cheap in the face of resource exhaustion.

To frame the Capitalocene in the terms of the Psychozoic, then: the
Psychozoic is an era defined by humanity’s pervasive and transformative
organization of nature, beginning with the Neolithic, whereas the
Capitalocene is an epoch defined by the phase beginning in 1450 when our
organization of nature became dedicated to discovering and appropriating
new forms of Cheap Nature that could be used as capital. There would be
no sense in reviving the Psychozoic era as a proposed geological
boundary---it is less able to withstand the scientific complaints leveled
against it than the Anthropocene is, and is probably less useful anyway. But if
the Psychozoic *were* an era, the Capitalocene could be an epochal
subdivision within it.

The theories are fundamentally different, however, in their motivations
and the tenor of their responses. LeConte, like many of his
contemporaries, sees the geologic reign of the human as an improvement
to a natural history based on violence and waste. Moore, in touch with
the catastrophic outcomes of capitalism’s planetary transformations,
frames the Capitalocene as a theory that is necessary to calibrate
political resistance, part of a broader tradition of anti-capitalist
critique. Norris’s place on this spectrum does not have the clarity of
LeConte’s or Moore’s theories, of course, but two things *are* clear.
First, that Norris depicts the capacities of human-natural-technological
assemblages to transform the environment on a planetary scale, but only 
when those elements
are brought together by economic forces. And second, that *The Octopus*,
if not in the programmatic or orthodox manner of someone like Jack
London, contains a powerful critique of capitalism’s effects on the
planet. With these two threads of his magnum opus, Norris’s
interpretation of LeConte’s Psychozoic comes to resemble something
closer to Moore’s Capitalocene.

*FORCE AS ASSEMBLAGE: NATURE, HUMAN, CAPITAL*

It is not hard to read *The Octopus* as a story of accumulation
through appropriation and the relations of production and power, the
basis of any critique of capitalism. It may actually be hard *not* to.
But to read the novel as a critique of capitalism’s environmental
consequences, especially at a geologic or planetary scale, is another
matter, one that has so far eluded most Norris criticism despite building on
some of the major trends in that body of work. Here again the split
between economic and ecocritical readings is partially to blame. Donald
Pizer’s take on “the concept of nature” in *The Octopus*, for example,
reconciles the conflict between religious and evolutionary
understandings of nature through the evolutionary theism central to
LeContian force.[@pizer_concept_1962] Russ
Castronovo discusses the “geo-aesthetics” and the tension between
democratic and proto-fascist impulses in Norris’s depiction of the globe
without touching on the planet, taking up the economic and political
without considering their environmental
implications.[@castronovo_geo-aesthetics:_2003] Florian Freitag brings
a more agricultural lens to the novel as part of a broader argument
about the farm novel as the “natural environment” of American literary
naturalism, but for him nature and the corporation are both competing
forces determining the actions and “cycles” of the individual---capitalism
*becomes* an environmental force in itself, making it hard to read the
effects of capitalism *on* the environment.[@freitag_naturalism_2009]
Paul Formisano, in an extended ecocritical reading of the novel, engages
more extensively with environmental transformations in the
San Joaquin Valley. In the struggle over water and land rights that
accompanied the creation of an agricultural oasis in the valley,
Formisano reads the broader conflict of distinct cultures and interests
over the right to determine California’s future, demonstrating “how
violence and conquest...go hand in hand with the state’s economic
development.”[@formisano_presleys_2015 15] But without thinking on a 
planetary-geological scale of space and time,
what Norris reveals about the influence of the capitalist system itself
on the fate of the planet cannot come into focus. Whereas the competing 
forces of nature, humanity, and captial seem to contradict each other and
remain distinct in the novel, attending to the ways they combine and
co-determine each other reveals a logic similar to that of the Capitalocene.

And yet, the case for a Capitalocene reading of *The Octopus* might seem
easily dismissed by reference to the following passage, one of Presley’s
musings as he contemplates the place of the human set against the
immensity of the San Joaquin Valley:

> And there before him, mile after mile, illimitable, covering the earth
> from horizon to horizon, lay the Wheat. The growth, now many days old,
> was already high from the ground. There it lay, a vast, silent ocean,
> shimmering a pallid green under the moon and under the stars; a mighty
> force, the strength of nations, the life of the world. … As if human
> agency could affect this colossal power! What were these heated, tiny
> squabbles, this feverish, small bustle of mankind, this minute
> swarming of the human insect, to the great, majestic, silent ocean of
> the Wheat itself! Indifferent, gigantic, resistless, it moved in its
> appointed grooves. Men, Liliputians, gnats in the sunshine,
> buzzed impudently in their tiny battles, were born, lived through
> their little day, died, and were forgotten; while the Wheat, trapped
> in Nirvanic calm, grew steadily under the night, alone with the stars
> and with God.[@norris_octopus:_1986 448]

Presley is unambiguous. Human agency is just so many gnats, at most an
annoyance to something we can never truly affect. Confronted with the
sublimity of something as enormous as the Wheat, something on the same
scale as the stars and God, the notion that humanity has some capacity
to effect a meaningful transformation is surely nothing more than an
arrogant overestimation of our powers.

On the other hand, what is the force, the “colossal power,” that Presley
confronts here? It is certainly “the Wheat,” but that hardly means he is
talking about the planet, or Nature, or even a humbler
lowercase-n-nature. Or, as Annixter would put it, parroting his favorite
catchphrase: “In a way, it is, and then, again, in a way it isn’t.” The
immensity with which Presley is faced is a monocultural planting of a
non-native plant, a state of affairs that is a distant cousin of the
natural and has almost nothing to do with the wild. It is a hybrid that
is a distinct *product of collective human agency*, and in recognizing
its enormous power, he is already giving the lie to his own claims about
the limited scope of human influence on the natural world in the context
of capitalism.

What is most curious is that, despite Presley’s interpretation of the
wheat dwarfing human agency, the capitalist (and therefore partially 
human) origins of wheat are folded
deliberately into the consciousness of the novel and Presley’s own
consciousness. He overhears a Mexican centenarian observe as much over
lunch, discussing the California of his youth: “There was no thought of
wheat then, you may believe. It was all cattle in those days, sheep,
horses…. Yes, and there was wheat as well, now that I come to think; but
a very little…. what would Father Ullivari have said to such a crop as
Señor Derrick plants these days? Ten thousand acres of wheat! Nothing
but wheat from the Sierra to the Coast Range.”[@norris_octopus:_1986
21] Presley knows shorty after the novel begins, then, that the wheat 
only exists in California
because of the “human agency” of the first colonizers, and that it is
only exists at the scale it does because of “Señor Derrick” and his ilk.
If he can still claim, four hundred pages later, that human agency
cannot touch the immensity of the wheat, one has to ask what different
forms of agency are at play here. Perhaps the “squabbles” among
individuals cannot touch the wheat, and perhaps not even collective
action could do so. But the kind of organization of humanity and nature
alike that capitalism represents---the assemblages represented when the
Derricks’ “no longer felt their individuality” as they commune with the
global wheat markets---demonstrably can.

Indeed, recognizing the multiplicity of forces at play, which come 
together as an assemblage rather than a unity, allows these contradictions
to be reconciled. Another such
contradiction arises within the passage itself and suggests that any attempt to
read the “colossus” as wild nature or to read human influence as
restricted to individual actions will fall short. The sentence in which
the wheat is most powerful is also the one in which its hybridity is most
apparent: “Indifferent, gigantic, resistless, it moved in its appointed
grooves.” The first question this sentence raises is, Grooves appointed by whom?
Whoever farms the land, apparently, particularly if the immediate referent for “grooves” is taken
to be the furrows of industrial ploughs. There is a
distinctly mechanistic character to the metaphor that will
recur in other descriptions of the valley’s wheat land and that implies
agency on the part of the farmers. And yet, how can the
wheat both move within “grooves” appointed by farmers and be out of the
reach of human agency? It can only be resolved if the wheat is taken as
*already* an assemblage of industrial activity and the properties of the
various species of wheat. The
wheat as an organism is not resistless, certainly, otherwise it could
not have been domesticated; as we have already seen, humanity itself is a mere
gnat; but in this industrial-natural assemblage, humanity and wheat
become the elements of a colossus.

The term "assemblage" here needs some definition for this context. I take it,
as have Haraway and many others, from Deleuze and Guattari to refer to the 
agencies produced by a combination of abstract relations and concrete material
entities.[^ln-assemblage] But I use the term primarily as another name for 
Moore's "bundles of human and extra-human nature...processes and projects
that reconfigure the relations of humanity-in-nature, within large and small
geographies alike."[@moore_capitalism_2015 179] The kind of agency at work
in *The Octopus* is unable to be reduced to any of its component parts or 
a unity of them. Rather, it is the heterogeneous whole organized by
capitalism in order to epxloit the relations between human and natural labor.
What is produced is meant to be an exchange-value producing machine, but 
ends up becoming the autonomous force of capitalism itself, destroying the 
capitalist through recurring crises but becoming indomitable as a force
in its own right. 

[^ln-assemblage]: Cf. @nail_assemblage_2017.

While this heterogeneity might seem to contradict the apparent unity implied
by "force," the inconsistent use of the term itself shows the same logic 
as an assemblage: parts and relations working as a whole without losing
their distinctness. Norris uses of the term to
refer first to life, then to the machine, and then to wheat as an interaction
between these entities and human labor within the larger systems
of the market and world consumption. Though defined by evolutionary theism 
in the LeContian mode,[@pizer_evolutionary_1961] its signification in the novel
tells a slightly different story. In the most quoted passage on the force 
alone, it comes to
signify that which “brought men into the world” as well as “crowded them
out of it to make way for the succeeding generation,” that which “made
the wheat grow” as well as “garnered it from the soil to give place to
the succeeding crop.”[@norris_octopus:_1986 634] It is life and death,
but also planting and harvest, population dynamics, and human history---
and while force brings these processes into relation, it is also defined by them.

As in Annie Derricks' vision, the clearest relation in this assemblage is
between industry and nature. That first sense in which force is used, the 
cycle of life, death, and decay that paves the way
for more life, is the first one encountered in the novel. After the
harvest, the wheat stubble covers the plains, dessicated by the sun, but
“the natural forces seemed to hang suspended” and “there was no growth,
no life; the very stubble had no force even to
rot.”[@norris_octopus:_1986 13-14] We see natural force *via negativa* in
the suspension of the life cycle. But the natural domain of force is 
quickly extended to the railroad,
and, by no coincidence, this extension occurs in a scene in which a
train slaughters a straying flock of sheep. Presley hears the train
whistle, and sees in his mind’s eye “the galloping monster, the terror
of steel and steam” as a “symbol of a vast power, huge, terrible,
flinging the echo of its thunder over all the reaches of the valley,
leaving blood and destruction in its path.” This mechanical monster has
nothing to do with the growth of wheat in a direct sense---it is not one
of the steel ploughs---but it nevertheless takes on the mantle of “Force”:
it is “the leviathan, with tentacles of steel clutching into the soil,
the soulless Force, the iron-hearted Power, the monster, the Colossus,
the Octopus.”[@norris_octopus:_1986 51] The force exists as a dialectic
between the vitality of nature and the "soulless" entities that 
extinguish it.

The capitalist relation of nature and technology resolves this dialectical 
tension into a new agency through assemblage. The novel’s conclusion, 
perhaps its most famous and controversial
aspect, marks the maturation of wheat into its own autonomous force,
born out of natural and economic forces but independent of both and bent
on asserting its agency over the planet. Wheat is, crucially, not
wheat as an organism when it takes on this role. It is wheat the
commodity, as it is being shipped overseas to create new markets and
fulfill new demand.

When the novel’s villain S. Behrman confronts this new force, it is the
first time he has done so as an individual and as flesh. It is not even
the wheat itself he means to see, but part of the larger industrial
apparatus, the
grain elevator. Although he has bought and enlarged the elevator, “he ha[s]
never seen it” before this moment: the “work had been carried on through
agents.”[@norris_octopus:_1986 639] In other words, he has created it
through the various dematerialized operations of the financier, but
confronting it on the material plane is categorically different. He has
been responsible for planning and executing the accumulation through
appropriation that has led to this moment of confrontation, having
“watched it harvested...watched it hauled to the railway,” and now
intends to revel in his success by watching “as it pour[s] into the hold
of the ship” and as that ship sails away---it is a depiction of the entire
supply line from the perspective of the financier. But the reduction of
Behrman to an individual here---it is the first time he is humanized, the
first time his emotions are on view---makes a distinction between the man
and the system in which he has played the crucial role. Having created
this assemblage, he removes himself from it, and thus sees it from
without.

This act of separation shows the extent to which it is capitalism, 
rather than capitalists, that the force of wheat embodies, for 
despite being responsible for everything in the situation, he will not
make it out of this confrontation alive; the wheat will crush him. The
sorcerer has lost control of his spells. His mistake is in unleashing
it, apparently, for what distinguishes his operation is the refusal to
pay the four cents for bags, and he lets it flow in bulk into the hold
of a ship. The other fatal mistake is in letting it get fully beyond the
human: it is not that it has reverted to wildness, but that its new
form, one that at once encompasses the organism, the processed grain, 
the elevator, the men working on the docks, the waiting
consumers, and of course, the market. It is because of this
transcendence of the individual that it is possible for Behrman to
observe that “[n]o human agency seemed to be back of the movement of the
wheat. Rather, the grain seemed impelled with a force of its own, a
resistless, huge force, eager, vivid, impatient for the sea”---*even
though* it is his own actions that have caused the wheat to tumble into
the hold.[^10] The autonomy of this force is finally asserted as, having
tripped and fallen into the hold, Behrman is crushed by his own
appropriated wheat and the mechanisms used to monetize it. What might
appear to be a moment of optimistic determinism---especially given the
novel’s final line, that “all things surely, inevitably, resistlessly
work together for good”[@norris_octopus:_1986 652]---is really the
creation of a new world-historical, planetary force. It is global
capitalism’s appropriation of Cheap Nature embodied.

Finally, then, the "force" is defined by two things. First, it is
unable to be considered without recognizing its composition
by the many distinct parts of the system---including but not exclusively
the division of labor, for it also includes the human-nature relation,
raw materials, and as will be discussed further below, the market. And 
second, the autonomy of capitalist nature as an assemblage, which transcends
the conditions that created it in order to create conditions itself. 
But the assemblage's autonomy does not negate the responsibility of
those whose actions gave rise to it. Who those people are, however,
is a more complicated question than it might seem.

*WHO FARMS THE WHEAT?*

If monocultural farming of the land is responsible for this colossus,
that does not mean the buck stops with the farmer, for the farmer exists
within a larger system of market forces. The wheat moving within its
“appointed grooves” takes on a different cast in light of the commodity
futures market. Commodities traders speculate on the price of “futures,”
which are just contracts to deliver a quantity of the commodity at a
certain point in the future, fixing a quantity of the commodity at a
guaranteed price in a mechanism that ostensibly guards against
fluctuations in price and supply. In practice, futures trading can
*itself* create price fluctuations, as speculators who have an incentive
to drive the price of a commodity up or down do so by means that are
psychological rather than material, influencing the price by influencing
the confidence of other investors and buying stock through the cover of
agents. Taking into account Norris’s Epic of the Wheat as a whole, the
assemblage that makes the wheat so powerful would be composed not only
of the process of production (the domain of *The Octopus*), but also of
distribution and speculation (the topic of *The Pit*).

In a short story “A Deal in Wheat,” which anticipates Norris’s epic, he
makes clear just where the power lies in this assemblage, and it is
distinctly not with the farmer. The commodity market cuts both ways,
lowering and raising prices, and Sam Lewison is hurt by both: he is
driven off his ranch by artificially low wheat prices, then sees the
breadline closed in his face because the price of wheat is too high. The
cause is a speculator’s duel between Truslow, who was driving prices
down, and Hornung, who was driving them up. When they go up even further
than Hornung wanted, Truslow is to blame, and he profits by a scam that
provides the *reductio ad absurdum* of finance’s dematerialization of
material goods: he keeps unloading and reloading the same shipment of
wheat, selling it to Hornung at higher and higher prices; Hornung is
obliged to buy, because he must corner the market or bust. It is fraud,
but fraud that works on the normal logic of finance, the radical
separation of exchange value from use value, to the point that they are
nearly mutually irrelevant. The railroad and the futures market become
Truslow’s perpetual-motion investment machine, which runs on the
dematerialization of wheat and relies on being able to treat the market
as an autonomous zone of action.

But as Lewison reflects on the whole incident, he recognizes that the
structures Truslow and Hornung manipulate are not the bounded arena of
unlimited agency they think. They are entangled with a much larger set
of overlapping systems and unintended consequences, which as a whole
Norris represents as a single machine:

> Caught once in the cogs and wheels of a great and terrible engine, he
> had seen---none better---its workings.…The farmer---he who raised the
> wheat---was ruined upon one hand; the working-man---he who consumed it---was
> ruined upon the other. But between the two, the great operators, who
> never saw the wheat they traded in, bought and sold the world's food,
> gambled in the nourishment of entire nations, practised their tricks,
> their chicanery and oblique shifty “deals,” were reconciled in their
> differences, and went on through their appointed way, jovial,
> contented, enthroned, and Unassailable.

In this thumbnail sketch of the food system, the
production-distribution-consumption schema that Norris took as the basis
for his would-be Epic of the Wheat trilogy (*The Wolf* was to be the
third installment and discuss consumption and food shortages), it is
clear who runs the show. The farmer and the consumer are along for the
ride conducted by the speculators. The “appointed grooves” of the
resistless Wheat are appointed by the same people who set up the “cogs
and wheels” of the financial machine, the machine going around and
around collecting wealth without a thought for what happens on either
side.

Of course, this sketch has nothing to say about the actual planting of
the wheat, the decentering of which is its entire point; where *The
Octopus* picks up the thread is in showing how market logics drive the
decisions made about the actual planting and the actual soil. The
financial logic of planting decisions becomes visible when Dyke, the
laid-off engineer who has decided to take up farming, discusses his
decision to plant hops with Harran Derrick. The latter tells him that
because of crop failures in Germany and New York, hops are a safe bet:
“there’s likely to be a shortage and a stiff advance in the price. They
ought to go to a dollar next year.”[@norris_octopus:_1986 72] On one
hand, this is unsurprising: cash-crop farmers will plant crops that
yield the most cash. On the other hand, the extent to which the language
of the commodities market has infused agricultural planning reveals
something about the place of the farmer in the food-wealth production
system, and it is a little more complicated than the clear boundaries
sketched out in “A Deal in Wheat.” The farmers may be subject to the
whims of the speculators, but their defense against ruination is to
involve themselves in the same operations.

In the end, what *The Octopus* reveals about the relationship between
farming and finance is the extent to which farmers themselves, on
“bonanza” farms and smallholdings alike, have themselves become
speculators. Dyke’s example is a faint one and primarily shows how
finance influences agricultural planning and planting---the more explicit
argument for the financialization of agriculture comes in the figure of
Magnus Derrick and those like him. That he understands wheat first and
foremost in market terms is clear from the comparison of wheat with
gold. The “miner’s instinct of wealth acquired in a single night
prevailed,” and it is by this logic that “Magnus and the multitude of
other ranchers of whom he was a type, farmed their ranches. They had no
love for their land. They were not attached to the soil. They worked
their ranches as a quarter of a century before they had worked their
mines.” [@norris_octopus:_1986 298-9] Rather than being productive,
financialized farming becomes extractive, and the wheat becomes
dematerialized, nothing more than its price on the market. Magnus---by all
accounts one of the most successful wheat farmers around---replaces all
knowledge of agriculture with extrapolative musings on future markets:

> He was no farmer, he hardly knew wheat when he saw it, only he knew
> the trend of the world’s affairs; he felt them to be setting
> inevitably eastward…. [H]is very vagueness was a further inspiration
> to the Governor. He swept details aside. He saw only the grand *coup*,
> the huge results, the East conquered, the march of empire rolling
> westward, finally arriving at its starting
> point.[@norris_octopus:_1986 320-1]

More than forgiving a lack of agricultural acumen, the market in wheat
seems actually to reward it. Magnus’s downfall comes because he is
beaten in his market manipulations, not because of his extractive
methods.

In fact, the extent to which the farmers, the ostensible heroes of the
fight against the villainous railroads, become indistinguishable from
any other sort of capitalist could be taken as evidence that *The
Octopus* is not a critique of capitalism *per se* at all so much as it
is a critique of monopoly---and such a critique is easily assimilable
within the economistic worship of competition and “free” markets. In a
certain reading, the defeat of the Derricks and death of the farmers,
the novel’s central tragedy, could have been averted had they been able
to enact their own plan to exploit Cheap Nature’s. Their great hope, the
way they plan to beat the railroad, is to engage with the markets even
more than they do. Magnus is persuaded of this by a man characterized
repeatedly as a “capitalist” who tells him that if wheat growers are to
prosper, “we *must have new markets, greater markets*,” integrate the
entire operations and “break up the Chicago wheat pits and elevator rigs
and mixing houses” not by systemic change but by a profitable scheme of
their own.[@norris_octopus:_1986 306] In rooting for the farmers, which
it is hard not to do, we would seem to root for a different cog in the
capitalist machine.

What such a reading would miss is the extent to which the capitalist
critique is inseparable from the environmentalist critique, the
combination of which in turn rests on the novel’s sense of planetarity.
The “miner’s” mentality has a clear endpoint: “To get all there was out
of the land, to squeeze it dry, to exhaust it, seemed their policy.
When, at last, the land worn out, would refuse to yield, they would
invest their money in something else; by then, they would all have made
fortunes. They did not care. ‘After us the
deluge.’”[@norris_octopus:_1986 298-9] The image this policy leaves in
its wake is of post-agricultural lands that resemble exhausted mines,
denuded and destroyed. The effects of capital investment are abstracted
from their materiality as it becomes something like Marx’s famous dictum
that under the conditions of capitalism, “All that is solid melts into
air.” In this context, the defining statement on dematerialization takes
on a new aspect, for the dematerialization of commodities does not make
the effects it leaves behind any less material. (We might also ask how
much carbon that “melting” releases into the atmosphere, but that is
another matter.) As we see, through the mind’s eye of Magnus Derrick,
the tide of wheat rolling over the face of the planet, we have to also
see that tide going out, and what it leaves behind it.

If it is ultimately capitalism that farms the wheat, the novel presents
glimpses of an alternative agricultural regime led by a different kind
of farmer. Though Annixter also farms wheat and is involved in the same
plutocratic politics as everyone else, at least at the outset of the
novel his farm works on a markedly different logic. He uses the dead
remainder of the wheat crop to feed sheep, who in turn manure the soil,
creating a multi-species assemblage that ultimately builds the quality
of the soil.[@norris_octopus:_1986 23] He sees, as none of the other
farmers seem to, the problems inherent in capitalism-driven agriculture:
“That’s right, there’s your Western farmer…. Get the guts out of your
land; work it to death; never give it a rest. Never alternate your crop,
and then when your soil is exhausted, sit down and roar about hard
times.”[@norris_octopus:_1986 28] He approaches his farming
scientifically, having, as he supposedly does, “brains to his boots,”
but in his college years studied finance and political economy as well
as scientific agriculture.

This scientific and soil-focused approach present a symbolic
counterpoint to (following Marx) the “metabolic rift” created by
capitalism, the disruption of the cycle of nutrients in the planetary
ecology in which things crucial elements for soil health such as
nitrogen and phosphorous return to the soil through human and animal
waste as well as uneaten plant matter. A similar metabolic metaphor
appears in the strange form of Annixter’s compulsive eating of prunes to
aid in a disrupted digestive system, a repeated fact about Annixter that
receives the most emphasis when his farming techniques are being
discussed, and which is simply too strange to mean nothing at all. It is
perhaps no coincidence that his supposed “genius” is framed in terms of
a digestive metaphor. He is successful because of his ability for the
“memorising, devouring, digesting” of knowledge. Knowledge and soil
health come together in the form of intelligent farming practices, the
metabolizing of information and agricultural theory leading to a
functioning metabolism of material flows through human and natural
systems.

Annixter’s farming, compared to the methods of more avowed capitalists
like Magnus Derrick, presents an alternative future for farming and an
identification of the existing farming practices that avert the problem.
It is a duality embodied in the very name of Annixter’s farm, “Quien
Sabe.” On one hand, it could be read as “¿Quién Sabe?”---who knows? Who
knows what might happen if a sensible farming methodology were adopted
for the most basic crops in the global diet? And at the same time, who
knows what will happen if it is not? But it is also, and perhaps
primarily, “quien sabe,”---“who knows,” as in “he who knows.” Annixter’s
methods are indicated as the right answer to the problem of California
wheat farming. That this message is presented in Spanish is perhaps a
nod to the farming communities and practices that predate American
annexation of California as well as the wave of especially Portuguese
immigrants in whom London saw so many leads for a scientific
agricultural practice. Annixter’s ranch embodies the possibilities for
alternatives that are broken up by the monocultures of capitalism.

Who farms the wheat, then? It could have been farmer-stewards like
Annixter, improving the soil. But it is not. It is the capitalist
instantiation of agriculture that is extractive, leaves ruin in its
wake, and is in the moment of the *The Octopus* sweeping over the face
of the Earth. Financial markets determine planting decisions, but
perhaps more importantly structure the collective common sense of the
biggest agricultural producers.

*DOMESTICATING THE PLANET*

Finally, the issue comes to the fore of domestication, and the
human’s---or capital’s---“organization” of the environment entire. LeConte’s
Psychozoic rests on the idea that domestication is the means by which
humanity has assumed a geological status, which for him is the defining
factor of the Neolithic and speaks to a larger process of artificial
selection of useful species over dangerous ones. Over the course of the
novel, images recur of domestication-through-organization, a continual
making of collectivities out of individual humans and non-human animals.
In almost all cases, these images end in slaughter, but the
collectivizing act continues. The question is, who is doing the
organizing, of whom, and to what end. Norris’s assumes and transmutes
images of domestication to link the organization of human and
extra-human work, showing that both are ways to exploit the Cheap Nature
for the benefit of capital gain.

The first such image is the ill-fated herd of sheep who will be
slaughtered by the train. Herded by Vanamee on Annixter’s ranch, they
represent a sort of sublimity of their own, “[h]undreds upon hundreds
upon hundreds of grey, rounded backs, all exactly alike, huddled,
close-packed, alive, hid[ing] the earth from sight.” Innumerability and
organization make them a single mass, and they become “alive” in a sense
distinct from how they were already alive, namely, as something like a
single organism; in becoming so, they “hid[e] the earth from site,”
obscuring the natural with the organized-natural. The herd “was no
longer an aggregate of individuals. It was a mass---a compact, solid,
slowly moving mass, huge, without form, like a thick-pressed growth of
mushrooms, spreading out in all directions over the
earth.”[@norris_octopus:_1986 30-1] The control and aggregation is so
totalizing here as to abstract the sheep into another form of life
entirely, metaphorically in their resemblance to “mushrooms” but, in a
certain sense, literally as a domesticated sub-species. And yet,
organization itself is not a catastrophic event for the ranch as a
landmass. The sheep are herded, yes, and to a certain extent transformed
by organization, but they are part of Annixter’s scientific agriculture
scheme.[@norris_octopus:_1986 23] Norris seems to reject the idea that
domestication itself, or the organization of other beings, is inherently
destructive, as would be necessary for a direct critical inversion of
the Psychozoic theory. Nor, apparently, is it as persuasive as the
capitalist form of coerced organization: it is swept aside in a single
bloody gesture by the railroad.

The next in the series of domestication images occurs during the
jackrabbit drive. The people of the San Joaquin gather for their ritual
jackrabbit drive, a combination picnic and slaughter. The whole
community lines up on horses and in carriages to drive the jackrabbits
out of their hiding places among the stubble of harvested wheat. By
marching in an unbroken line, they drive them into a corral where they
are killed to supply a “Homeric” feast.[@norris_octopus:_1986 505] The
depiction of this roundup draws on the same reservoir of
collectivization imagery that characterized the herd of sheep. Even
though “[n]o two acted precisely alike,” they are able to be made into a
single monolith. As the sheep “hid the earth,” so do the rabbits: here
and there “what seemed to be ground resolved itself, when seen through
the glasses, into a maze of small, moving bodies…. The earth was alive
with rabbits.” The language describing them moves from their individual
actions to descriptions of them as a population, as their numbers
increase from thousands to tens of thousands and the “throng” grows
“denser and denser”; they are “a loose mass” and, finally, “a
sea...agitated by unseen forces.” The upshot is that “the rabbits,
singularly enough, became less wild”---even though their terror means that
“[a]t times the unexpected tameness of the rabbits all at once
vanished,” they remain, essentially, controlled.[@norris_octopus:_1986
500-1] The extended scene dramatizes domestication through organization.

This would seem to be another pure expression of the Psychozoic thesis,
showing domestication spread over the “earth” both literally
(lowercase-e-earth) and figuratively (capital-e-Earth, the planet). When
one considers the context of jackrabbit drives in environmental history,
however, the image takes a different focus. Why does this ritual exist?
Why turn out the entire valley for a gruesome ritual when it could be a
normal feast, like the one Annixter holds in his new barn? The answer
rests on the specific jackrabbit population dynamics that result from
capitalist agriculture. The jackrabbit drive is a cultural form adapted
for use in the industrial landscape from prehistoric and pre-colonial
indigenous traditions. As European colonies began transforming the
landscape, however, they inadvertently created the conditions for
periodic jackrabbit population booms, as shrublands and agricultural
fields make perfect jackrabbit habitats---and consequently, the potential
for plummeting agricultural yields as they destroy
crops.[@simes_black-tailed_2015 506-7] Hence the ability (and
necessity) of a line of horses and wagons to whip up a tumultuous “sea”
of rabbits: the booming population makes the mass unimaginably vast and
the rabbit drive a necessary act to protect their product; it is a
fundamentally economic operation that derives from the consequences of
other economic operations. And the “nature” they make tame only exists
because of other, previous forms of domesticating organization---it is a
“wildness” that arises out of plant domestication, only to be
domesticated itself.

The profit-protection scheme, disguised (as with ideology) by a co-opted
ritual, ends in slaughter. In an image that will be echoed later in a
human context, the rabbits flow *en masse* into the corral, and “like an
opened sluice-gate, the extending flanks of the entrance of the corral
slowly engulfed the herd” and the mass spreads out “precisely as a pool
fo water when a dam is opened.” Finally the domestication has succeeded
and “[a]ll wildness, all fear of man, seemed to have entirely
disappeared”; and “on signal, the killing beg[ins].” The dogs brought
there for the purpose refuse to do the killing, in a moment of
inter-species solidarity: they “snuffed curiously at the pile, then
backed off, disturbed, perplexed.” They appear not to recognize the
organized mass as prey. Humans do the killing, a club in each hand. As
much as Norris seems to exult in the violence, he underscores its
awfulness, albeit through a gauze of racism. The “Anglo-Saxon spectators
round about dr[a]w back in disgust” while the Portguese, Mexican, and
“mixed Spaniard” are “boiled up in excitement”; most retreat a quarter
of a mile away to prepare the barbecue. Norris’s preferred audience,
“Anglo-Saxons,” are supposed to be horrified by this display. Like the
massacred herd of sheep, capital concerns organize life in ways that are
presented simply as violence.[@norris_octopus:_1986 499-502]

Whether Norris was thinking of the rabbit drive as profit-protection is
unclear, but it certainly sets up the final scene of capital’s
domination through organization, the abortive mass movement against the
railroad. In the first example, a sustainability-minded farmer organized
sheep for the purpose of revitalizing the soil, and in the second,
farmer-capitalists organized jackrabbits for the purpose of protecting
their investment. The final example shows how powerful capitalists
organize society to protect their capacity for accumulation through
appropriation. They do so by treating labor as another raw material to
be organized, another form of what Moore calls “Cheap Nature,” through a
process that looks eerily like the
domestication-through-collectivization seen in the sheep and the
jackrabbit scenes.

Perhaps the most complicated aspect of this example is the fact that the
collective labor movement, “the People,” organizes itself. As with the
jackrabbits, this description begins with attention to
individuals---pedestrians who stream onto the streets to join the
movement---but quickly begins to deal in aggregates. Finally they become a
“crowd, a solid mass” from which “this single unit, this living,
breathing organism---the People” is born. Again individuals become a
single but distinct lifeform, and again they are motivated to do so by
the normal workings of the capitalist system: for it is the railroad’s
appropriative actions that compel them into the streets. Whereas the
jackrabbits lose their individual differences, Presley’s perspective
continues to provide the narrative lens. But his individual *agency* is
stripped from him as he is “caught in the current” with his arms
“pinioned to his sides by the press.” Likewise, the individual people
become “wave after wave of faces, hundreds upon hundreds, thousands upon
thousands, red, lowering, sullen. All were set in one direction.”
Particles become wave as terms of liquid dynamics and aggregation
provide the operative metaphors: Presley is “an atom on the crest of a
storm-driven wave” and is carried off here by a “groundswell” and there
by a “surge.” Finally, there is a direct visual echo to the jackrabbits
being herded into the corral. Here the corral is the terminus of the
march as it sweeps “up the steps of the Opera House, on into the
vestibule, through the doors, and at last into the auditorium of the
house itself.”[@norris_octopus:_1986 544-5] The Opera House becomes the
site of a metaphorical taming and slaughter, what happens when the
People rise up against the indomitable force of capitalism.

The analogue to domestication here is the co-opting of an existing
collective labor movement such that it defeats itself and exploitation
can continue apace. The League---the political collective the farmers form
to resist the railroad---is defeated for two reasons. First, the
plutocratic corruption of the democratic system is such that the only
way they can succeed is by buying seats on the commission that controls
tariffs. In other words, the political system is so imbued with monetary
influence that participating means participating in the corrupt
marketplace of that influence. Magnus, as the agent of this scheme once
his principled opposition to it is worn down, becomes tarnished, and the
railroad successfully runs a smear campaign against him. The march to
the Opera House ultimately founders on the rock of its compromised
principles, as paid hecklers reveal Magnus’s bribery. In this sense, one
leader of the movement is seduced, however unwillingly, by plutocratic
politics. The second reason the League fails is that the seat it “buys”
on the tariff commission has already been bought by the railroad---even
though it is Magnus’s own son, Lyman. Thus another sense in which the
movement, and more specifically its legitimation within the existing
structures of government, is co-opted in advance by the capitalist basis
of political power, just as existing alternative forms of social
structure (family and community, both of which Lyman forsakes) are
replaced by market relations. It is this replacement of one
organizational structure with another---representative politics with the
market---that ultimately “tames” labor.

On its own, this course of events might be taken to be a regional issue,
a problem framed in terms of a single, historically bounded monopoly in
nineteenth-century California, but Presley’s speech in the Opera House
enfolds it within the larger, world-historical movements of domination
and exploitation. Stirred by news that one more rancher wounded in the
shootout with railroad agents has died, he takes the stage to decry the
domination of “the People” by everyone from the Pharaos to the “white
Czar” to “Bourbon Louis.” Ultimately, he lands on capitalism itself:
“They own us, these task-masters of ours; they own our homes, they own
our legislatures. … We are told we can defeat them by the ballot-box.
They own the ballot-box. We are told that we must look to the courts for
redress; they own the courts.”[@norris_octopus:_1986 549-52] Yet it is
not just the corrupting influence of money in government that Presley
condemns. Since the death of his friends, he has embraced the
perspective of Caraher the “Red” saloon owner, radicalized into some
form of revolutionary collectivist politics.[@norris_octopus:_1986 535]
He thus rounds on the monetary structures themselves. “They swindle a
nation of a hundred million and call it Financiering; they levy a
blackmail and call it Commerce;....they hire blacklegs to carry out
their plans and call it Organisation; they prostitute the honour of a
State and call it Competition.” Finance, commerce, organization, and
competition are the means by which these farmers have been forcibly
organized, first for the purposes of appropriation and profit, and now
to be funneled into the place where their resistance will be dashed.
Such means are the equivalent of the line of horses and carriages
driving the jackrabbits. Presley’s speech ultimately falls on
appreciative but uncomprehending ears. The People are not educated
enough (a party-educated writer like London would probably say not class
conscious enough) to understand the meaning of Presley’s speech---he was
too “literary.” [@norris_octopus:_1986 551] But the reader, literary by
definition, is presumed to have understood.

The control of labor is just one more point in a clear line drawn from
the herding of sheep through the marshalling of jackrabbits and all the
way to the appointment of “grooves” through which the agricultural force
of wheat traverses the globe. Everything that has happened in the novel
has been part of a total system of organization for the purposes of
profitability. Framing the disruption of labor movements alongside
domestication through repeated imagery distinctly suggests that both are
part of the same process. As the number of influential actors dwindles
and agricultural activity comes further under the control of markets,
the possibility for alternatives like those enacted on Quien Sabe fades
in the face of a global monoculture. That monoculture is a
world-historical and geologic force resulting from what Moore would call
a “bundling” of human and natural forces, but it is categorically
distinct from both as a result. The creation of this new force takes
cues and inspiration from Joseph LeConte’s theory of the Psychozoic Era
in its emphasis on organization and domestication, but it replaces “Man”
as the defining agent with financial markets and the capitalist system.

**“The Measureless Ranch of Vision”: Landscape and Capitalocene
Aesthetics **

As Minna Hooven, separated from what is left of her family, approaches a
quaint cottage in San Francisco where she has been told she might find
work, she encounters an unexpected symbol of capitalism’s unintended
natural consequences: in addition to the native fan palm and magnolias
more characteristic of southeastern United States, the cottage is shaded
by “the inevitable eucalyptus.”[@norris_octopus:_1986 584] It is indeed
“inevitable” in *The Octopus*. Norris uses a mixed grove of oak,
cypress, and eucalyptus trees to define the setting of the Los Muertos
ranch house, which is often seen from a distance as “a roof or two
between the dull green of cypress and eucalyptus,” and it seems like
someone is always “pass[ing] out from under the eucalyptus trees” or
hitching their wagon to one of the sturdier
trunks.[@norris_octopus:_1986 176] The textual range of the eucalyptus
is far from restricted to Los Muertos, however, morally or
geographically. Indifferent to the Derricks’ struggle against S.
Behrman, eucalyptus groves surround the houses of both, and it will pop
up wherever the action is. It is an invasive species in the text of the
novel itself just as it is in the California landscape of today,
mentioned more often than any tree other than the California live-oak
despite being indigenous to Australia.[^11]

To see capital in the landscapes of *The Octopus*---and to begin to see
why landscapes matter in the novel’s economic plot---one has to look
beyond the controlled transformations of the wheat growers and into
accidents like the eucalyptus tree. If an encounter with the eucalyptus
is “inevitable” across California, it is only so because of the close
relationship between speculation and American agriculture from the
nineteenth century on---and, even more relevant to the context of *The
Octopus*, because of the economic impact of the railroad. The blue-gum
eucalyptus was introduced to California in the 1850s by farmers
“impressed with the splendid proportions and rapid development of the
genus in its native habitat” of Australia.[@state_board_of_forestry_handbook_1908 5] Its
presence across the state made it the logical candidate to meet the
growing demand for wooden railroad-ties, which continually increased as
the tentacular train routes of the Central Pacific Railroad spread
across the American West starting in the 1860s. California farmers were
wooed into planting Eucalyptus trees commercially in anticipation of the
coming hardwood shortage---among them, albeit somewhat later, Jack London,
who annotated articles on the promise of eucalyptus farming and was even
featured in pamphlets extolling the tree’s
profitability.[@london_jack_1916 JLE 2639] Eucalyptus wood was not
suited for railroad ties, in the end. It cracked, split, and became
twisted too easily to withstand the conditions of the tracks. But long
after the scheme collapsed, the trees remained
standing.[@wolf_management_2016] The species became invasive and
spread across the state, the side-effects of which have been as
disastrous as they were unanticipated. Besides being ill-suited to an
environment like the San Joaquin Valley, which gets so little annual
rainfall that some argue it should be treated as a desert biome, its
bark and sap are highly flammable, and it transformed the fire regimes
of the grasslands it invaded.[^12] Recently, eucalyptus came back into
the spotlight when a viral Reddit post entitled “The Great Australian
Shitpost, 100 years in the making” facetiously blamed century-old,
unscrupulous Australian profiteering for 2017’s devastating fires. But
from the perspective of the Capitalocene, capitalism itself is the more
plausible cause than individual capitalists---of the eucalyptus, the
denuded environment, and the climate change that combined to cause the
fires and will combine again to cause more. In the innocuous-seeming,
“inevitable” eucalyptus of Los Muertos we can see the destructive
effects of a landscape determined by capital investment, effects that go
well beyond the obvious purview.

Norris’s greatest novel halts its progress periodically to record the
state of the landscape, a structuring device that most obviously traces
the growth cycle of the wheat crop, but more subtly reveals the
environmental transformations that accompany the actions of the primary
economic and agricultural narrative. In the scale of these intentional
changes, accompanied by their unforeseen consequences, there arises what
can be called a Capitalocene aesthetic. The Capitalocene aesthetic is
defined by landscapes that evoke a tension between natural-seeming
sublimity and the increase of humanity’s capacities through aggregation
into the global capitalist system. On one hand, in the Kantian mode of
the sublime, Norris’s landscapes have the sense of “transcending every
standard of the senses” by forcing a confrontation of that “in
comparison with which all else is small,”[@kant_critique_2007 80-1]
and the related Romantic visual sensibility of the lone figure dwarfed
by such an enormity. On the other hand, the very landscapes that he
depicts, which are supposedly beyond the reach of human thought, are not
beyond the reach of human action---quite the opposite, they are to a great
extent *determined* by human action. Norris aestheticizes this paradox
in landscapes created by the actions of individuals who have been folded
into the structures of capitalism such that their capacities for
transformation exceed the limits of the imagination. The Capitalocene
aesthetic is the meeting point of Marx’s statement that capitalist
society is “like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the
powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells” and
Wordsworth’s “huge Cliff” that “As if with voluntary power instinct, /
Uprear'd its head” over the “bound of the horizon”: it is the former
rendered in the latter, and the latter created by the former.

What distinguishes this theory of a Capitalocene from other
theorizations of sublimity in adjacent contexts is the phenomenology of
being integrated into a system, opening the possibility of feeling
oneself as also part of a world-historical, sublime force. Daniel
Darvay, for example, similarly recognizes Norris’s assumption of an
aesthetic of the sublime in *The Octopus*, but not the extent to which
the characters’ senses of agency are simultaneously increased to the
same scale through aggregation. Referring to a “naturalist sublime” in
which the individual will is dominated by natural, historical, and
economic forces, Darvay points out that naturalist characters are
“invariably turned into victims of destructive powers” so vast as to be
sublime, but if they exert any agency at all, it is “only to perpetuate
and reinvent the very ideology that led to their
destruction.”[@darvay_naturalist_2015 45] In contrast, taking this
Capitalocene aesthetic as the basis for a reading of *The Octopus*
recognizes the ways in which, as with the eucalyptus tree or the vast
wheat fields, observers encounter a natural sublimity that is a product
of runaway human agency, experiencing both in equal measure. David A.
Zimmerman takes the sense of being integrated into the system as part of
the feeling of the “mesmeric sublime”, saying that “market panic invites
but defies comprehension (and literary representation), and the
pressures of the speculative marketplace...disintegrate the boundaries
that distinguish and protect the mind from the
market.”[@zimmerman_frank_2003 63] This can be combined with a sense
of controlling the market individually, as Jadwin in *The Pit* tries to
do by cornering the wheat trade, but Norris always crushes these
individual attempts at control, as Zimmerman rightly points out.
Extending his insights from the context of *The Pit* to *The Octopus*,
it must be asked how being integrated with the market changes the
contours of individual agency, especially when it happens simultaneously
with an encounter with natural sublimity. Capitalized farming more
properly becomes a confrontation between two forces of sublimity, with
the farmer-capitalist as a simultaneous observer and participant.

Most evocatively in the first half of the novel, these landscapes are
rich veins for seeing the effects of capitalism on regional
landscapes---in this case California, but Norris is insistent in
generalizing the situation of California to the globe as wheat markets
become global.[^13] It will first be necessary to understand how Norris
invokes existing landscape aesthetics in order to break from them,
before moving on to show how sublimity inscribes a limit around
imaginative capacity while simultaneously showing that individual
actions exceed that capacity through systemic integration by capital.

That the landscape mode is so central to *The Octopus* might seem
peculiar, given the treatment he gives the one actual landscape painting
that appears in the novel; in fact, Norris’s critique carefully
demarcates the role of landscape in concealing or revealing the place of
finance in the land itself. When Hartrath, an artist “absolutely devoid
of even the commonest decency,” presents a landscape painting to be
raffled in support of a Gingerbread Fair, the piece itself is set up for
mockery. In “a frame of natural redwood, the bark still adhering,” the
painting depicts the Contra Costa Foothills. Nothing in the painting
itself appears objectionable: Norris emphasizes technique, demarcating
clearly “the foreground” where, “under the shade of a live-oak, a couple
of reddish cows” stand “knee-deep in a patch of yellow poppies,” and
noting the compositional balanced provided by “a girl in a pink dress
and a white sunbonnet.” There are some indications of an impressionistic
style in “shadows...indicated by broad dashes of pale blue paint.” But
this very unobjectionable quality, this lack of a serious subject
matter---its title indicates that it is just “A Study”---draws Norris’s ire.
We can see it in the derivative commentary of the audience and in
Norris’s efforts to make sure we know it is derivative:

> The ladies and young girls examined the production with little murmurs
> of admiration, hazarding remembered phrases, searching for the exact
> balance between generous praise and critical discrimination,
> expressing their opinions in the mild technicalities of the Art Books
> and painting classes. They spoke of atmospheric effects, of middle
> distance, of “*chiaro-oscuro*,” of fore-shortening, of the
> decomposition of light, of the subordination of individuality to
> fidelity of interpretation.[@norris_octopus:_1986 310-1]

Technical admiration comes necessarily from “Art Books and painting
classes” rather than from the minds of the women themselves. This may
be, and probably is, an assumption that the female audience cannot
possibly have anything original to say. But it is also an implicit
critique of the academic art promoted by nineteenth-century France’s
*académies* that leaned heavily on classical models studies like
Hartrath’s---a school of thought in which Norris would have been well
steeped, having studied art at the Académie Julian from
1887-1889.[@teague_frank_1994] Here, academicism and technical
virtuosity come to mean blithe acceptance of, or even complicity in, the
economic status quo. When Hartrath expresses hope that his inoffensive
painting of a lost Eden will attract “Eastern capitalists” to spend
money at the fair and invest in San Francisco, a hostile interlocutor
suggests that San Francisco’s own capitalists have already denuded it of
any meaningful investment vehicles: “our business men preferred to
invest their money in corner lots and government bonds, rather than to
back up a legitimate industrial enterprise. We don’t want fairs. We want
active furnaces.”[@norris_octopus:_1986 302-3] An untroubled landscape
in the academic mode, arcadian scenes well rendered, are linked with the
frivolities of finance, even if they shy away from the more actively
destructive industrial enterprises that finance engenders and relies
upon. Natural simplicity in landscapes works like ideology, concealing
the real conditions of exploitation governing nature and labor alike.

If Hartrath’s landscape invests in arcadian simplicity, Norris’s
insistently repeat the pastoral rejoinder: *Et in Arcadia ego*. And yet
even the simplicity of the pastoral mode is symbolically rejected, both
the neo-classical pastoral that, as Raymond Williams points out, excises
all “living tensions” from rural life and the more complex pastoral of
the earlier, Virgilian mode that dwells in the contradiction “between
the pleasures of rural settlement and the threat of loss and
eviction.”[@williams_country_1975 16-8] Presley, searching for
material for his neoclassical epic of the West, sees the pastoral scenes
from which he drew inspiration violently retracted: the herd of sheep
that he watches from a high vantage point, which can be taken to
symbolize pastoralism, are slaughtered by a passing train, a massacre
that Norris lavishes with gory detail---“backs were snapped against fence
posts; brains knocked out” and the tracks run with blood. From that
point on, understandably, “The sweetness was gone from the evening, the
sense of peace, of security, and placid contentment was stricken from
the landscape.” Presley’s inspiration and the aesthetic it relied on
vanish in an instant. Hartrath’s painting acts as *mise-en-abyme*,
inviting meditation on the landscape form itself; the “slaughter of the
innocents” that interrupts Presley’s moment of landscape-making takes
pastoralism off the table as a viable landscape aesthetic, with
Presley’s epic standing in for Norris’s own.[@norris_octopus:_1986 50]
And just as Presley gives up the epic mode in favor of a more
accessible, contemporary, and political medium, Norris renounces the
neoclassical aesthetic of his Académie training to consciously expose
the exploitative relations of capital that inhere in the alluvial soil
of the San Joaquin Valley.

The passages of landscape themselves are insistently visual and
multimedial without replicating the Romantic or academic aesthetics of
the nineteenth century. Rather, Norris does something that in some
senses anticipates documentary landscape photographers of the late
twentieth and early twenty-first centuries like Edward Burtynsky or J.
Henry Fair, who use distant, often aerial shots to show the effects of
industry on the land, and in doing so expose the workings of the capital
flows responsible. The first time Norris presents a landscape, any
recognizable nature it might have contained, idealized or no, has been
systematically rooted out. Riding his bike in search of inspiration,
Presley at first sees a wasteland:

> All about him the country was flat. In all directions he could see for
> miles. The harvest was just over. Nothing but stubble remained on the
> ground. With the one exception of the live-oak by Hooven’s place,
> there was nothing green in sight. The wheat stubble was of a dirty
> yellow; the ground, parched, cracked, and dry, of a cheerless brown.
> By the roadside the dust lay thick and grey, and, on either hand,
> stretching on toward the horizon, losing itself in a mere smudge in
> the distance, ran the illimitable parallels of the wire fence. And
> that was all; that and the burnt-out blue of the sky and the steady
> shimmer of the heat.[@norris_octopus:_1986 13-4]

As with many of Norris’s landscapes, this one begins with an invocation
of the form: he establishes a point of view and range, the equivalent of
a visual frame. But it is almost an empty frame, a mere horizon line of
the flat country that extends to the limits of vision. Certainly there
are no charming bucolic visions, as in Hartrath’s corral-cum-picnic, nor
even crops, exactly---just the “stubble” left over after the harvest. The
single tree (the live-oak, a native species) only emphasizes the absence
of life in the rest of the scene, invoking *via negativa* what has been
taken away. The passage becomes increasingly painterly as Norris
delimits his pallet with the sole purpose of excising green: “dirty
yellow” stubble, a “cheerless brown” surrounding it, the “burnt-out blue
of the sky,” and the unnatural grey of dust that might just as well come
from the nearby road as from the earth. Finally, the “smudge” of the
distant fence invites a transmedial interpretation---while it can indicate
a blurry mass in the distance, its primary meaning is a mark on a
surface that has been rubbed to indistinctness.[@noauthor_smudge_nodate] The
insistent visuality of the passage has as much to do with the painter in
front of the canvas as it does the observer on the hill.

The primary visual tension, however, is between the two sources of
infinite expanse, the replication of these ranches over the face of the
planet and the “illimitable” wire---in other words, precisely what
violates the visual frame. The first indicates the scale of extraction
and despoliation, while the second, which concludes the passage, points
to its source: the husbandry of land symbolized by the fence. While the
fence limits, it is itself “illimitable,” a reminder that the situation
defining this scene extends well beyond what Presley can see. In this
endless extension---and, formally, its repetition across the recurring
landscape passages---Norris again breaks from the landscape tradition
invoked by Hartrath’s painting by rejecting the limitations of
foreground, background, and frame. In doing so, he creates a sense of
the planetary that relies on capital to be envisioned. It was, after
all, the creation of a whole through aggregation, and one might even say
imaginative enclosure or appropriation, that constitutes the most
stunning effect of the stock ticker on the Derricks’ consciousness,
making their farm one unit in the global production of wheat.

This endless expanse may constitute a rejection of the Romantic
picturesque, but it shares elements of the Romantic sublime. On another
of Presley’s journeys, he achieves a similar effect by an insistence on
pushing the frame wider and wider, the horizon further and further back.
At first, the aesthetic mode is that of the *rückenfigur*, the outline
of a figure contemplating a landscape that leaves a space for
imaginative projection of the viewer---or in this case, the author, as
Norris himself toys with the Romantic and epic modes by which Presley is
consumed. “As from a pinnacle,” Presley looks out over the novel’s
geographic range, outlining its key locations in order of proximity:
“First, close at hand,” the Seed ranch, and “beyond that...the Mission
itself,” “farther on... Annixter’s ranch house,” and “far to the west
and north” Bonneville. Everything else is lost in a haze, as “other
points” that “detached themselves, swimming in a golden mist, projecting
blue shadows far before them,” like Caspar David Freidrich’s “Wanderer
Above the Sea of Fog” of a different hue. Were it to stop here, this
landscape would adhere to the Romantic landscape tradition of the
sublime, invoking the feeling of immensity but not doing anything
particularly new.[@norris_octopus:_1986 45-6]

But the landscape pushes further, as literary extrapolation takes it
beyond the frame of the visual---and the only reason it is able to surpass
what is unimaginably vast is because the object of contemplation shifts
from nature to enterprise. Though dwarfed by the immensity of the scene,
Presley nevertheless “dominate[s] the entire country” from his perch on
the hill. What was just sublime suddenly “seem[s] to be only foreground,
a mere array of accessories---a mass of irrelevant details.” Whereas the
first thing Norris does in describing Hartrath’s painting is to
delineate foreground and background, in Norris’s own landscapes, these
distinctions break down, creating a sublimity that results precisely
from surpassing the existing landscape aesthetic. The vision goes beyond
any limitations, reducing everything to “irrelevant details” in its
wake: “Beyond Annixter’s, beyond Guadalajara, beyond the Lower Road,
beyond Broderson Creek,” always further beyond. Individual landmarks
give way to indistinct expanses of sameness as the bigger (and therefore
more industrial) ranches come onto the scene: “infinite, illimitable,
stretching out there under the sheen of the sunset forever and forever,
flat, vast, unbroken, a huge scroll, unrolling between the horizons,
spread the great stretches of the ranch of Los Muertos, bare of crops,
shaved close in the recent harvest.” The operative metaphor of the
“scroll” here invokes both the materiality of a landscape sketch (like
“smudge”) and the image of writing, agriculture becoming in turn a kind
of human signature on the land in the form of bare, shaved crops.
Further, as in the first landscape, the description “illimitable”
distinguishes the technological sublime from the natural: through the
human signature, the technology of writing breaks the visual frame that
was able to contain the natural sublimity.[@norris_octopus:_1986 46-7]

Reproducibility marks the difference in the logics of the sublime and
the limitless extension of agency through capitalism. The former is a
confrontation with the whole web of interconnections of which the self
is a small part, agency diminished by context. The latter believes that
the web of interconnections can be reduced to only those that are
profitable, plot by plot, and that the process can multiply. Hence the
ability for “a frost on the Russian steppes” and “a hot wind on the
llanos of the Argentine” to be part of the same system from the
perspective of the stock ticker: the ranch mentality reduces the
distinctiveness of these landscapes to a single metric,
yield.[@norris_octopus:_1986 53-4] As the ranches multiply in Presley’s
mind, the complexity of the landscape, inversely, collapses; the
Broderson Ranch and the “Osterman ranch...carr[y] on the great sweep of
landscape; ranch after ranch.” The uniformity caused by monocultural
production of wheat allows for the extension of the pattern even beyond
the realm of vision, sublimity both contained by and containing the act
of reduction:

> Then, as the imagination itself expanded under the stimulus of that
> measureless ranch of vision, even those great ranches resolved
> themselves into mere foreground, mere accessories, irrelevant details.
> Beyond the fine line of the horizons, over the curve of the globe, the
> shoulder of the earth, were other ranches, equally vast, and beyond
> these, others, and beyond these, still others, the immensities
> multiplying, lengthening out vaster and vaster.

What was just “illimitable” becomes, somehow, “mere foreground,” because
the purview is no longer the framed landscape, but the “measureless
ranch of vision”---vision serving double-duty here as literal visual
perception and “vision” in the sense of imaginative extrapolation. The
ranches spread out in front of Presley, however endless they seem,
matter most in what they indicate, the endlessly repeating ranches, the
scale of which only becomes apprehensible when the frame is widened
enough, encompasses enough, that one can see the “curve of the globe.”
In other words, Norris must invoke an image of planetarity to account
for the scale of wheat production, an agricultural phenomenon
inextricably linked to commodities markets; but it is only in the
capitalist organization of nature into Cheap Nature that the planet can
be grasped at all.

This growth is the growth on which capitalism relies; this is also the
immensity that so defines sublimity. The Capitalocene aesthetic, to
reprise, is defined by this apparent tension between the creation of
immensity and the annihilation when faced with it. It is not only an
imaginative crisis in the face of a vast system, but the experience of
being part of that system and therefore feeling oneself as part of it,
the tension between infinite diminution in the face of indomitable
forces and infinite increase through aggregation with the capitalist
system itself. As Norris’s landscape-making extends beyond Presley and
assumes the perspective of those more integrated into the system of
production and profit, the description becomes something between a
landscape and a self-portrait, depicting the expanse of land as at once
beyond the viewer in every sense and an extension of self. Hints of this
paradox mark the novel’s ending, as Behrman is crushed by the
wheat-industry-labor assemblage of which he himself has been
constitutive, but it exists primarily as a tension written into the land
itself.

Where before the “illimitable parallels of the wire fence” marked the
human side of conquest, and were observed from afar, a similar image is
repeated as Vanamee joins the line of ploughs---but now he is *part* of
that illimitable line. Having been discharged as a shepherd when the
railroad killed his flock, Vanamee has joined the workforce on Quien
Sabe to help with the ploughing. In the buildup to the moment of
aesthetic landscape-making, he is brought defintively into the fold of
physical landscape-making through industrial labor. The landscape mode
is initiated as he “climb[s] to his seat, shaking out his reins, and
turning about, look[s] back along the line, then all around him at the
landscape inundated with the brilliant glow of the early morning.” What
he sees, besides the wet earth, revitalized by rain and ready for the
sexualized ploughing scene, is the extent of the transformation in which
he himself is involved. The ploughs “stretched in an interminable line,
nearly a quarter of a mile in length, behind and ahead of Vanamee,”
organized “*en echelon*.”[@norris_octopus:_1986 126-7] Again there is a
paradox of measurement: both limitless and a quarter-mile, as the
ploughing of Quien Sabe ceases to be merely itself.

Vanamee, too, ceases to be merely himself as the landscape is
interrupted by dramatic mechanized action. Just as the Derricks lose
their sense of individuality and become market cyborgs, feeling the jerk
of the ticker and the hot winds of Argentine plains just as naturally as
the ground they stand on, Vanamee’s sensory range extends into the teeth
of the ploughs themselves as he becomes part of the wave motion: as the
ploughmen receive the signal to begin, a “prolonged movement ripple[s]
from team to team” and the clicks, creaks, and clashes of the industrial
laborers become of a piece with the cracks, breaths, and commands of the
pre-industrial, equine laborers. Here again collective becomes organism
as Vanamee feels the “moist living reigns slipping and tugging in his
hands” while he loses his own sense of self and humanity in the
“confusion of constantly varying sensation”---the “vibrating seat” easily
becomes an extension of the “quivering...prolonged thrill of the earth,”
and Vanamee himself becomes numb, “enveloped...in a vague, slow-moving
whirl of things.” Ultimately, “not a clod was turned, not an obstacle
encountered, that he did not receive the swift impression of it through
all his body.”[@norris_octopus:_1986 128-9] What interrupts the
landscape, in other words, is Vanamee becoming coextensive with the
landscape itself by participating in its total and mechanized
transformation. He does become lost in the mechanical echelon of
ploughs, but those ploughs themselves are hard to separate from the
earth (and the Earth) that has been made to rely on them in its natural
cycle of reproductions---that is itself, as in the eyes of Annie Derrick,
a mechanized terror.[^14]

The landscape mode abruptly resumes when the line of ploughs is halted
by a mechanical failure; when it does, its scope again becomes global,
and with it, the extent of Vanamee’s actions. The logic is similar to
the multiplying immensities of Presley’s landscape in which everything
becomes mere foreground. Plots of land, individual ranches, concatenate
and aggregate until they cover the globe. But there is a key difference.
Building on the narration of ploughing and Vanamee’s integration into a
vast cyborg-assemblage of animals, industrial technology, and humans,
the increase of scale is now an increase in the scale of transformative
action.

Vanamee, a mere “speck” himself when set against the immensity of the
globe, sees the rest of his operation as just more “moving specks.”
Elsewhere, they fade into indistinctness as Norris again uses painterly
description to indicate the failure of perception and imagination: the
ploughs become simply “a long, brown streak upon the grey of the
ground.” Only moments ago he was an appendage in the machine, induced
sensorily into the transformative actions of the whole. Merely halting,
becoming a contemplative observer, again induces sublimity, the
conditions of imaginative failure and diminution, but it is now with the
awareness that he is part of what made that sublimity.[^15] It is a
shift that reveals, at the same time, the coexistence of the planetary
scale of action and the failure of the imagination to conceive of the
transformations it induces.

Frank Norris’s Capitalocene aesthetic does something that is of great
importance to the twenty-first-century environmental movement in
anticipating a fundamental question about the limits of our
environmental imaginaries, posed by Dipesh Chakrabarty: “If, indeed,
globalization and global warming are born of overlapping processes, the
question is, How do we bring them together in our understanding of the
world?” Abstracting his question away from just global warming, which
defines the scope of neither the Anthropocene nor the Capitalocene, we
can see in Norris’s work an aesthetic attempt to do just that, to bring
together the nascence of globalization with the transformation of nature
it engenders. Most provocative in Norris’s anticipatory response to this
question is its simplicity. He tells us to look at the land, to look at
how it got that way, and to read the realization and failures of
intentions. But he also institutes an implicit meta-discourse on the
aesthetic requirements of representing world-ecological processes by
simultaneously taking up and subverting the Romantic aesthetics of
natural representation that preceded him. What these earlier aesthetics
lack in contrast with Norris’s is an understanding that nature is always
part and product of human systems, which are themselves always part and
product of nature. In other words, that nature is historical and history
proceeds *through* nature. Depicting this relationship takes attention
to markets simultaneously with attention to the natural world, a mixture
that the unfinished Epic of the Wheat is uniquely suited to pursuing.

[^ln-pizer]: Donald Pizer’s “Synthetic Criticism and Frank Norris; Or,
Mr. Marx, Mr. Taylor, and The Octopus” compares two influential readings
of themes in *The Octopus*: Leo Marx’s use of the novel to
confirm the trend of conflict between nature and the machine as symbols
in the American consciousness, and W. F. Taylor’s theory in *The
Economic Novel in America* (1942) that American novelists have a problem
“not industrialism *per se*, but the workings of an industrial order
administered by a *laissez-faire* capitalism.”[^2] How Pizer attempts to
resolve these mainlines is indicative of the difficulty in doing so
without a tool to think with like the Capitalocene. He presents a moral
reading of nature in suggesting that the “moral center of the novel
is...nature, and evil is the failure to understand the processes of
nature or the attempt to thwart them.” But somehow, in bringing economic
critique to the table, this reading of nature also reads any critique of
capitalism straight out of the novel: as well as failing to comprehend
the birth-death-rebirth cycle, “the ranchers and the railroad fail to
realize the omnipotence and benevolence of the demand which determines
the production and the distribution of wheat.”[@pizer_synthetic_1963
535-6] In other words, in order to reconcile a nature-focused reading of
*The Octopus* and an economic reading of it, Pizer has to not only
naturalize but celebrate, almost deify, the market logics of capitalism
through the “natural” laws of supply and demand. The purpose of this
reconciliation, however, is to push back against the "synthetic 
criticism" that both authors embody in favor of a "critical eclecticism"
that would allow both threads to be explored in isolation. That is
largely what has happened.

[^8]: See @clive_hamilton_was_2015 60. Hamilton and Grinevald seek to
    downplay the significance of these precursors, for the explicit
    reason that they fear a “deflationary effect” on the theory of the
    Anthropocene.] While the Psychozoic is certainly not credible in
    stratigraphic terms---the “golden spikes” that constitute
    stratigraphic evidence would not be formed until the Great
    Acceleration---it is hard to understand why a theory that is
    explicitly termed an “Age of Man” in geologic time would not be
    taken as a precursor, however flawed.

[^10]: Elsewhere, the meanings multiply. In an often quoted passage, the
    “FORCE,” all in capitals, comes to signify that which “brought men
    into the world” as well as “crowded them out of it to make way for
    the succeeding generation,” that which “made the wheat grow” as well
    as “garnered it from the soil to give place to the succeeding
    crop.”[@norris_octopus:_1986 634] It is life and death, but also
    planting and harvest.

[^11]: An inventory of plants mentioned in the novel would read:
    oak/live-oak: 23; eucalyptus: 15; magnolia: 8; chaparral: 7;
    cypress: 6; manzanita: 3; poplar: 3; palm: 2.

[^13]: Here I break from Paul Formisano’s reading of environmental
    transformation in *The Octopus* as primarily a California matter.
    Furthermore, I choose to privilege the interior of Norris’s novel
    against his subtitle (*The Octopus: A Story of California*). *The
    Octopus* is no more a pure story of California than *The Pit* is a
    pure story of Chicago: both concern themselves with the global, and
    at the very least national, movements of capital.

[^14]: [I probably need to check out Seltzer here]

[^15]: It is a peculiar inversion of Vanamee’s mysticism, one of the
    aspects of the novel that most annoys its critics, but now the
    integration into a holistic organism is part of the systems of
    capitalism itself rather than part of a misty vision.
