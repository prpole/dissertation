Notes on Norris Articles

Ach (intro)

- About McTeague, so not of direct interest
- Argues that arid landscapes in general seem to be overlooked, and Norris's Death Valley in particular
- Reading of the desert is as a not-super-defined "queerness" embodied in the landscape that she says is full of contradictions (though, is it?). But there's a more general interest in the desert as a place of self-making and extra-human relationality that could be kind of interesting. Definitely should be cited in recent ecocritical work on Norris/naturalism

Berte (intro)

- interesting -- sets the literal map in the front-matter alongside the "textual maps," the space as it is described in the novel itself. 
- Reads these literal and figurative "maps" as depictions of overlapping forces in the Le Comtian mode that Norris subscribed to
- Part of the argument here is to counter the reading of naturalist space as deterministic and urban, which could be very useful in my own attempts to do the same with mapping. Follow up on her sources. Probably not useful for my Norris chapter, but almost certainly in the introduction

Castronovo (intro)

- should read for chapter---talking about the globalist aesthetics of Norris's work, particularly the Epic of the Wheat. Points out the historical role of wheat in creating a certain kind of global agrarian collectivism

Cavalier (intro)

- a somewhat boring execution of an interesting connection between rape and extraction as they come together in the figure of gold in McTeague---and some great passages/context on mining as a domestication and destruction of land

Darvay (intro)

- reads the "naturalist sublime" as the sense/realization of domination by an overwhelming Le Comtian "force", rendering free will and human action miniscule and insignficant, unable to really enact anything at all---"puppets". I don't think this is helpful to me but it's interesting in terms of the Le Comtian force thing and a reading of naturalist determinism

Dawson (intro)

- useful only for Norris's sources and historical antecedents

Duvall (intro)

- really interesting, noting the preponderance of junk and the different types of junk/uses to which it is put throughout Norris's work. Some food waste, some salvage, some reusable, etc. Suggests a larger interest on Norris's part regarding the waste side of consumerism
- generally helpful in exploring the naturalist obsession with consumption/the depiction thereof

Formisano (intro)

- California as a promised land that turns out to be a "tarnished ideal," a space of determinism and material 
- interesting stuff about "force" and its applications in the hard sciences---related to order and organization
- examination of water and land rights in california and the underpinnings of california agriculture

Lee (intro)

- skip - basically defending the ending

Mrozowski (intro)

- takes Steinbeck's "Who can I shoot?" in reference to corporations as an occasion to trace corporate embodiment in naturalist novels and particularly The Octopus; links the question of limited liability to discussions of individual agency in naturalism. Supes interesting. Revisit

Wood (intro)

- explores sadism (via Jadwin's 'Vae Victus' reverie) as a natural extension of dominating other speculators

Zimmerman (intro)

- super interesting but probably not relevant to my work, this article traces the convergence of economics's "invisible hand" with the rise of spirit mediums and so forth in Hamlin Garland's The Shadow World (which I should probably read)

Freitag

- !! notes that despite the apparent urbanity of the genre, many of the major novels are set on farms
- points to the repetitions of farm life (seasonal cycles, drudgery) as in line with Mitchell's version of cyclical determinism; should also potentially include Fleissner
- Very intresting passage: "Of course, one may argue that the underlying theme of most American farm novels, the pioneer's material progress (see Freitag), undercuts nature's repetitive patterns and thus its control over the farmer---in fact, the very idea of agriculture is that of controlling and channeling nature's forces into the production of specific plants and animals." Continues: the farmers who are most materially successful, though, are those who adhere to nature's "cycles" (I hate this cycles business but it's interesting for my purposes; makes determinism a demand for cooperation) 100
- Pizer, "Three Phases," dubs it the novel of group defeat when "a powerful social or economic force causes the fall of a particular class or group of men"
- describes corporations on the farm as "machines in the garden"! Whooeee, that's complicated
- Dang, this is helpful: "To be sure, one might argue that similar to nature with its cycles of seasons and night and day, corporations and trusts, too, are environmental forces that inevitably and, even more importantly, disinterestedly determine the protagonists' lives." (101)

Lundblad, "Birth of a Jungle"

- Exploring the discourse of the jungle and animality in progressive-era literature: "The central claim of this book, though, is that texts from the turn of the century that are often thought to epitomize this kind of logic also include varied forms of resistance to the Darwinist-Freudian jungle, particularly as they explore alternative formulations of human violence and sexuality. Critical attention to what else animality might signify during that period can reveal alternatives to the growing hegemony of the jungle." Very useful to me in terms of establishing and opposing the standard story about the nature "red in tooth and claw" (which, by the way, apparently comes from Tennyson)
- source: "Bert Bender’s Evolution and “the Sex Problem”: American Narratives during the Eclipse of Darwinism (2004) goes to great lengths to distinguish between the work of Darwin and, for example, that of Joseph Le Conte, Henri Bergson, Peter Kropotkin, and Ernst Haeckel"
- proposes "animality studies" as an additional field alongside animal studies, the aim of which is (I think) to historicize the animalization of human subjects and groups, "and how discourses of human and nonhuman animality have produced various identity categories within the human"; for Lundblad, this particularly means in the early-20th-century moment of evolutionary obsessing;

- "But there is a thread in studies of literary naturalism, I believe, running from Michaels to Fleissner, that continues to overlook the complexities of what it means to be an animal, the “natural” side of the human, in texts that both produce and resist the discourse of the jungle at the turn of the century" 

- covers the nature fakers controversy in ways that could be useful for London chapter; would it be useful to cover London in terms of animality? Probably not; I think Haraway is more useful; e.g. see p. 23 on the hierarchy of animals, white people, and so-called "savages" in "The Other Animals"

- should read chapters 1 and 2 on London and Norris, respectively

Schmitt, "Wilderness Novel in the Progressive Era"

- narrates an interesting moment in which "wilderness novels" and those "who communed with nature at their writing desks" had a boom; in the first decade of the twentieth century
