## Chapter One (London) informal abstract

Broadly speaking, I am investigating the ways species, race, and horticultural
systems collide in Jack London's agricultural novels, especially *The Valley of
the Moon*, and how these coinciding themes prefigure the difficulties of using
the human *species* as a heuristic in the Anthropocene. In *The Valley of the
Moon*, Billy and Saxon attempt to use agriculture as a route to a "human
species" identity that is able to be experienced directly, a search that is
complicated and at times supplanted by contradictory perspectives on race. At
first, London seems to present a form of white supremacism, as his protagonists
revel in a shared "Anglo-Saxon" lineage through which they understand their own
experiences and desires. But later, they represent this lineage of conquest and
exploitation as the very thing that has stripped the American landscape of its
vitality and created the separation of town and country that they experience as
a loss of humanity. In order to experience their humanness, they must resist
the same racialized identity through which they previously understood
themselves and learn from the superior human ecology they see in practice on
the immigrant-owned farms of California. Conceiving of possibilities in the
human-nature relationship thus becomes a site of conflict between species and
race in London's eyes, just as it has a century later in discussions of the
Anthropocene.

As the proliferation of alternatives to the term "Anthropocene" demonstrates,
the "Anthropo-" prefix has been as contested in the humanities as the "-cene"
suffix has been in the sciences. "Anthropo-" seems to assign equal culpability
and equal risk to all humans, regardless of how one has benefited from the
fossil fuel economy or how imminently one is endangered by its climatic
outcomes. At the same time, understanding the effects of human activity
geologically seems to require a universalization of humanity, an act that
exceeds the bounds of human experience and the scope of human histories to
date. As Dipesh Chakrabarty puts it, "Species may indeed be the name of
a placeholder for an emergent, new universal history of humans that flashes up
in the moment of the danger that is climate change. But we can never
*understand* this universal. [... C]limate change poses for us a question of
a human collectivity, an us, pointing to a figure of the universal that escapes
our capacity to experience the world" (221-2). 

At the end of his life, Jack London's dual obsession with species and
race was joined by a third obsession, "natural" living and farming techniques.
Living and working an experimental farm in the Sonoma Valley, London's writing
began to expound the theories on which his agricultural practice was based,
outlining industrial agriculture's despoliation of the land in contrast to
methods that develop the soil's richness rather than stripping it of its
resources. In the background of these material and literary explorations are
contemporaneous works such as Bolton Hall's *Three Acres and Liberty*,
a touchstone of the "back to the land" movement, and F. H. King's *Farmers of
Forty Centuries*, a study of "permanent agriculture" methods in East Asian
nations. Rather than being seen as a departure from his better known animal
novels and travel narratives, this ecological turn in London's work should be
understood as an extension of his long-standing attempts to account for what
Marx would call the human "species-being," or the defining behavior of
a species, and to navigate the contradictory views on race that define much of
his fiction.
