Well, it's one of my feelings anyway that all this talk, people expressing
concern over what's going to happen to the human race---I don't think they
really care. The human race as an abstraction is not really interesting, you
see. It's the individual human beings you're attached to, and if you consider,
they'll all be dead in a hundred years anyway, I don't think most people
really know what they're thinking about when they talk about the human race.
Faceless thing, really. It's the individual people that matter. Maybe I'm just
not idealistic enough. 

One of the ideas I like to play with is that there may have been a superior
human race in the past. There's no reason why there shouldn't have been.
There's no reason why we should be the best there ever was. When you look at
some of the achievements, like the development of language---that's just an
incredible thing. It strikes me that there were some real genius types
somewhere along the line there that did a lot of things.
