"The term ['Anthropocene'] has rapidly become adopted in the humanities in
a sense beyond the strictly geological. Its force is mainly as a loose,
shorthand term for all the new contexts and demands---cultural, ethical,
aesthetic, philosophical and political---of environmental issues that are truly
planetary in scale, notably climate change, ocean acidification, effects of
overpopulation, deforestation, soil-erosion, overfishing and the general and
accelerating degradation of ecosystems." (2)
