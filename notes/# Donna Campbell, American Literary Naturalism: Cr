# Donna Campbell, American Literary Naturalism: Critical Perspectives

For "not a movement" note: "As Nancy Glazener points out, the term ‘naturalism barely surfaced in influential journals except with reference to Zola, and … the authors we associate with naturalism were not grouped together by contemporary reviewers’ (6)." Glazener, Nancy. Reading for Realism: The History of a U.S. Literary Institution, 1850-1910. Durham: Duke University Press, 1997. Qtd. in 500-1
