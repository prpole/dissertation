vs period:

"The benefit of this enlargement of  temporal  scale  is  to  make
possible---not inevitable, but theoretically possible---a narrative vision of
human ethical development that  would  be  simply  invisible  at  the  scale of
the local and the short-term. Why would criticism voluntarily deprive itself
of this additional scale of transperiodic vision and the aggregations it
brings into view?"
