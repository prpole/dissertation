[This vision of industrial robotics creates an interface between materiality and
information: programmed commands, which are merely particularly structured acts
of communication, become coextensive with the material transformations they
cause. Robinson's robotic manufacturing technologies are so important to his
environmental thinking because they bridge the assumed gap between environment
and our understanding of environment, decreasing the distance between
structures of the mind and structures in matter. ]

[To summarize, then, these semi-intelligent industrial robots allow for the
translation of imagined environments into material environments, and through
them Robinson narratively establishes technology as an interface between an
individual utopian imaginary and material praxis. But because these utopian
imaginaries are concerned with the circulation of energy and physical material
in an ecological system (however nascent), we have to rephrase this equation:
technology is an interface between an individual *ecotopian* imaginary and
*environmental* praxis.]
