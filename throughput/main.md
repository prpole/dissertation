    Regreening Technology&#58; Gestures Beyond Prometheanism in Kim Stanley
    Robinson's *Mars Trilogy*
geometry: margin=1in
---

Almost a thousand people stand on Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in our
solar system, and watch as an ice asteroid leaves a gash in the newly minted
Martian atmosphere. The asteroid has been commandeered by UN-approved robotic
ships that have landed and converted the material of the asteroid itself into
fuel, altering its trajectory for this calculated near miss. The assembled
crowd aren't in it for the fireworks, though. They are a thousand among many
Earth expats who have undertaken every project conceivable to turn Mars into a
surrogate for Earth, the planet humanity has exhausted. This ice asteroid will
add valuable heat and water into the Martian atmosphere, bringing it one step
closer to being able to support life---even as it takes the planet one step
further from what we think of as "Mars."

By the end of *Red Mars*, the first in Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy, we
have witnessed atmospheric alterations as modest as the cultivation of
ever-hardier bacteria to those as audacious as drilling enormous holes through
the Martian crust to tap the heat closer to the planet's core. By the end of
the third book (*Blue Mars*), humans native to Mars lounge on the beach of a
Martian ocean. But just as important to the novel's mission as these
atmospheric changes are the economic, political, and philosophical shifts that
come with them. The creation of an atmosphere can only happen simultaneously
with the challenge of what a Martian constitution will look like, or, more
relevant to my purposes, of adapting Earth-based understandings of
environmental activism to a planet without a biosphere. 

"Science fiction" and "sustainability" seem just about made for each other:
both are vexed terms, and both take on arguably too much. The most serious
examples of both require us to think through the intersections of technology,
ecology, sociopolitical systems, and the place of the human in the universe.
At the intersection of these two fields, Robinson uses the space of the "dead"
planet as a laboratory for social-ecological experiments, both testing the
limits of our environmental concepts and imagining the possibilities of human
development without the constraints of Earth's particular biosphere. I want to
isolate one product of this experimentation in particular for discussion here,
namely, the role of technology in what we might call the novel's "ecotopian
imaginary," or the utopian social ecology its narrative creates.

I raise this topic not for its own sake, nor to participate in terraformation
fantasies (much as I'd like to), but to consider the place of technology in
utopian environmentalism and environmentalist discourse more generally. It has
a particular importance as the state of the planet risks degrading beyond the
point at which merely preventing further destruction, though necessary, is
likely to be sufficient in dodging catastrophe. Much discussion of technology
in environmentalist discourse, however, has been understandably suspicious of
any technological "fix" to problems that many see as the fault of technological
development in the first place. Perspectives  that emphasize technological
development are often seen as (and often are) "Promethean," or in other words,
based in the Baconian premise that "nature" is something to be mastered and
bent to the human will. We are therefore left in a difficult bind. We may need
an environmentalism capable of integrating industrial-scale technologies, but
we can hardly be expected to trust the technophilic thinking that got us here
in the first place. 

The Mars Trilogy contains the beginnings of a reconciliation. Robinson depicts
a relationship between technological innovation and ecological stewardship that
could redefine "green" technology from being merely less destructive
alternatives to being methods and tools by which humans actively promote the
development of robust ecosystems. The perspective his narrative creates
gestures beyond the Promethean, defining the usefulness of a particular
technology in terms of its benefit to nonhuman natures rather than the other
way around. It also recognizes the dangers inherent in capitalist appropriation
of "greening," and the ecological dangers of geoengineering projects conceived
as vehicles for capital investment. But at the center of this perspective is a
more basic unity: the confluence of ecological, technological, and social
imaginaries to form a critical ecotopianism.

But before I can talk about any of this, I have to talk about robots.

***

"Robotics" in Robinson's hands looks considerably different from the more
familiar version associated with, say, Isaac Asimov---humanoid robots who are
made to serve in the way humans serve, and whose fictional instantiations are
sometimes taken as proxies for class struggle or enslavement.[^ln-robot-slaves]
In much of Robinson's work, robots appear in the form of mobile industrial
machinery that places an unfathomable transformative power in the hands of the
programmer. These robots are rarely discussed in themselves, existing almost as
a lacuna where labor and exploitation usually lie, between intention and
realization. But what we do know is that a small group of people are able to
effect the enormous transformations necessary for human inhabitation of Mars,
and that most of their "work" is in deciding what ought to be changed and how.
Robotic machinery, in other words, both frees the colonists up to imagine
alternative material environments and gives them the power to make those
environments actual. The specific interface between human and robot Robinson
establishes creates a space in which the ecotopian imaginary becomes
narratively visible.

We never get to see what the human-robot interface looks like, exactly, but it
can be inferred that it combines high-level human input to establish the broad
strokes of a plan with intelligent automation to take care of the details---and
that it is *not* a transmission of information specifying where to place each
plunge of the drill. As is required for "intelligence" in any artificial
system, the details are determined by the robot receiving and interpreting
feedback from the material reality it encounters.[^ln-wiener] The result is
that human "creation" and transformation are merely a matter of communicating
some feasible thing one wants to happen, but doing so in a structured way a
robot can understand. The actual labor is reduced to making a good plan and
figuring out how to relate it. In this particular industrial army, to put it
another way, everyone is a general. 

One example of this process has already been presented---the robot landers that
capture an ice asteroid and bring it into the Martian atmosphere. Very little
of this process is seen in the novel itself, but one of the more explicit
examples comes in a moment of crisis near the end of *Red Mars*. Someone
sabotages a water station that taps into a large aquifer, and the hydrostatic
pressure beneath the surface of the planet threatens a catastrophic explosion
that would create the first Martian ocean where a major town used to be. Any
hope of preventing this disaster relies on their ability to collapse an
overhanging cliff onto the site of the break, containing the pressure and
plugging up the hole---and to do so within a matter of hours.  Nadia, a
character particularly occupied with construction, takes over:

> During the ride over she had directed all the town's construction robots from
their hangar to the foot of the north wall, next to the water station; when the
two rovers got there, they found a few of the faster robots had already
arrived, and the rest were grinding over the canyon floor toward them. There
was a small talus slope at the foot of the cliff.... Nadia linked into the
earthmovers and bulldozers and gave them instructions to clear paths toward the
talus; when that was done, tunnelers would bore straight into the cliff.... The
slower robots arrived, bringing an array of explosives left over from the
excavation of the town's foundation. Nadia went to work programming the
vehicles to tunnel into the bottom of the cliff, and for most of an hour she
was lost to the world.

One of the more detailed acts of construction in the novel, this moment is a
particularly telling portrait of what human labor looks like in the early
stages of Robinson's Mars. If we want to know what Nadia actually does, we can
just look at the verb phrases of which she is the subject. By the time the
cliff is brought down, Nadia has "directed," "linked into," and spent several
hours "programming," all of which can be summed up by the phrase "gave them
[the robots] instructions." Meanwhile, the robots were "grinding" out their
efforts "to clear paths," "bore straight into the cliff," and thereby "tunnel"
their way to Nadia's intended result. Nadia does the thinking, the robots do
the work. 

No surprises here. But it's important to note that the robots are more
intelligent than mere tools, fundamentally changing the nature of the human
user's interaction with the machine. The ability to "clear a path," imagined
from a programmer's perspective like Nadia's, would require an ability to take
in and synthesize feedback (in this case, debris) encountered along the way,
freeing the programmer from the necessity of accounting for each rock along the
way, as she would in, say, a bulldozer. The same is true in any of the tasks to
which the industrial robots are set, because so many of them contain shifting
or unknown variables. The division of labor Robinson imagines therefore relies
on advanced systems in two areas: networks of communication for the
transmission of instructions and complex intelligent systems to allow those
instructions to remain on a high level of abstraction, excluding the minutiae
of each step. 

This latter point, maintaining a high level of abstraction, is important,
because doing so keeps the instructions to the machine in the language of the
human imagination. In programming, a "level of abstraction" refers to the
specificity with which a program is elaborated, from "move all the files into
that folder and rename them one through ten" (high level of abstraction) to the
same instruction in binary, which refers more directly to the charge of the
bits on the disk that will achieve the same result (low level of abstraction).
We can apply this to Nadia's own process of programming as the difference
between telling a robotic machine to "build me a house" (highest) and
programming each movement and manipulation of the machine's apparatus (lowest).
Narratively and robotically, the level of abstraction in this human-robot
communication is such that we see the plan form in the characters' minds, thus
understanding how these transformations to the environment will take place
before "seeing" it in materially realized. As readers of these moments, we come
to assume any concrete transformation to the environment that can be imagined
can be made to happen because the language of action and imagination are kept
on the same plane. Imaginative events blend with physical events, both
narratively and in the lives of the characters.

Of course, most of these acts of imaginative and physical "creation" don't look
so much like destruction. Though this particularly violent moment of
transformation is useful in revealing the narrative mechanism for linking
thought and action, in most ways it is anomalous. Moments of crisis-aversion
are few and discrete, whereas patient construction is continuous and defines
the trilogy. The same methods that Nadia uses to plug up the punctured aquifer
are used by all of the first hundred colonists to build their settlements and
pursue their terraformation efforts. Communal shelters are built out of bricks
from automated "brick factories," which are set up to convert the materials at
hand in the inorganic rock surface of the planet (the regolith) into a usable
form.  Most exciting (if also most improbable) is the ability "to construct
soil just like they had...magnesium bars" by converting leftover nitrogen into
fertilizers that can be mixed with the rocky regolith, supplementing soil from
Earth and organic material from greenhouses with these human-produced mixtures.
This process, too, entails communicating the plan for constructing soil to a
series of robots, now in the form of factories, but it is not a matter of
pounding rocks into particularly useful shapes or collapsing geographical
structures. It is the quiet work of creating the foundations for life, work
that is usually automatic but not planned, the product of millennia of material
flows. Robinson's colonists translate their careful attention to nonhuman
natures into construction projects that will allow those natures to flourish.

For this translation to work narratively, the industrial robots have to be
programmable in a relatively short amount of time by a single person. We have
to be able to witness the attention to nonhuman nature and its instantiation as
a plan in order to fully realize the shape of an ecotopian imaginary, and this
witnessing is easier when it's focused on a single subject. Robinson directs
our attention to the plan rather than the execution, allowing us to
imaginatively short circuit the robotic laborers and suppose that "thinking
makes it so." Eliding the grittier engineering problems is a recurring fantasy
in Robinson's work, even if he never loses sight of the material constraints
his characters face. It is a fantasy that is most clearly expressed in his most
recent novel, *Aurora* (2015), when one character, admiring someone with a
special aptitude for engineering, exclaims: "So she fixes things by thinking
about them!" What is "fixed" in the Mars Trilogy is most often the inability of
the atmosphere to support life.

The vision of one who "fixes things by thinking about them" could be taken as a
neat encapsulation of the utopian imaginary---not surprising, given that the
phrase comes from one of the only self-identified utopian authors
extant.[^ln-robinson-utopian] Focusing his utopian thinking on the material
flows between the human and its surroundings, Robinson develops *his* version
of an ecotopian imaginary, elaborating a speculative social ecology in which a
(mostly, eventually) democratic process informed by ecological principles is
allowed to determine the formation of the ecosystems that contain it. But he
puts that same ecotopian capacity in the minds of his characters---and
supplements it with the means necessary for meaningful environmental
praxis---by using robotic technology as a narrative device for translating
thought into physical transformations. The multiplicity and variety of his
characters' ecotopian visions allow what are usually philosophical debates to
play out in the laboratory of the material world. But at least on Mars, an
ecotopian imaginary's only bridge to reality is formed by accepting the role of
highly transformative material technologies and mobilizing them in pursuit of
alternative social ecologies. It may not put it too strongly to say that he
uses his robotic technologies to make the Martians' ecotopian imaginaries
matter.

As I'll discuss, this conclusion is considered in the context of Earth as well
as Mars. Creating the conditions for an ecology where those conditions do not
exist already, as is the case in Mars terraformation, is not so different from
imagining *fixes* where the conditions necessary for life have been stripped
away. But when the question of highly transformative material technologies is
reframed in terms of Earthling environmentalism, things get much more
complicated.

***

Breaking the barrier between human thought and environment; unlimited powers of
environmental transformation---all of this might sound like nature is something
to be conquered by science, human ingenuity, and ever-more-developed tools. At
the very least, isn't it anthropocentric? The environment is, after all, being
changed to be more friendly to the human. Not to mention that the vast
determining power put in the hands of an individual organism seems anathemic to
anything approaching ecology, in which, as a fundamental tenet, everything
affects everything in a complex web of interconnections. 

Robinson's form of environmental thinking can be difficult to reconcile with
environmentalist discourse more broadly because of a longstanding tendency to
align technology or "technological fixes" with natural exploitation and human
domination of the natural world---that is, to bundle technological development
with what is often called a "Promethean" perspective of the environment. It's a
term that comes up in many ecological critiques of Marxism that are
uncomfortable with the continued relevance of evolving means of production in
his work, critiques that Paul Burkett and John Bellamy Foster have effectively
rebutted.[^ln-burkett-foster] But a look at some more direct definitions of the
term from an environmentalist perspective shows that technology itself is not
inherently Promethean. As John Dryzek defines it, it refers more to an economic
understanding of the human-nature relationship: 

> Prometheans have unlimited confidence in the ability of humans and their
technologies to overcome any problems presented to them---including what can
now be styled environmental problems....In their more extreme moments,
Prometheans believe that a total control of nature is within our grasp, once
nature is fully understood....[^ln-dryzek-1] 

Prometheanism justifies endless growth with a belief that any limitations can
ultimately be overcome by the total transmutability of matter (here is where
technological fixes come in), creating an inexhaustible supply of natural
resources. We can just invent our way out of any problems a high-consumption
lifestyle might create, says the Promethean---and therefore, there's no reason
to reduce consumption or worry about exploitation. Other understandings of the
term are similarly economically inflected. Foster traces it back to Proudhon,
for whom Prometheus was a figure exemplifying the triumphal human translation
of nature into economic value.[^ln-foster] The more definitions one reads, the
more Prometheanism actually comes to sound like another name for capitalism. 

Even if these are essentially arguments about economic perspectives of nature,
their emphasis on technology has led to some slippage between critiques of the
Promethean perspective and technology itself. Dryzek points out that
Prometheans talk about nature as though it is a machine, made of "simple
components---ultimately, simple resources" that can be "pieced together" to fix
any problem.[^ln-dryzek-2] Among the assumptions Dryzek brings into the orbit
of a technocentric approach to nature is that nature is "seen in inert, passive
terms," language that resonates with other similar critiques.[^ln-merchant] All
things considered, it's hard to imagine, say, a deep ecologist being very
excited about factories that grind an environment into its component parts and
spit it out, brand new and inherently changed, on the other side. 

But what would a deep ecologist do with a planet that doesn't have an ecology,
that might actually *be* best understood as, if not dead or inert, than at
least without life? The environment of Mars makes the relevance of concern for
nonhuman natures much more complicated, and it forces us to ask some difficult
questions about what the goals of environmental activism ultimately are, on any
planet---a question with clear implications for the environmental ethics of
technology. 

Robinson stages this debate by embodying it in distinct characters, political
affiliations, and ideologies, all of which can be summed up as a debate between
the "reds" and the "greens." Red and Green might translate to communist and
environmentalist on Earth, but on Mars it indicates one's support either for
the maintenance of Mars in an untouched state or for the propagation of life
and a robust ecology. It is a question that we simply have no need to pose
without Mars or a planet like it, because on Earth there is no difference
between these two goals. Introducing the Martian environment into the
discussion, though, forces us to ask: when we talk about conservation, is it
limiting the human's impact on its environment (full stop) that we care about?
Or do we care about limiting human impact only insofar as it impedes the
propagation of nonhuman life? 

Perhaps for tactical reasons, conservationism on Earth usually leans heavily on
destruction or disruption of nonhuman life as the reason to care about human
influence on the ecology. But without any life to speak of, the "conservation"
framework gives way to the question of whether purposive human determination of
its environment is fundamentally unethical or distasteful. The debate plays out
in Robinson's novel most explicitly between Sax (Saxifrage Russel, whose
namesake is, to William Carlos Williams, "my flower that splits / rocks") and
Ann Clayborne (whose surname seems to imply that she is the rock to be split).
Sax is the main proponent of terraformation by any means necessary, while Ann
advocates minimizing human impact in order to promote the study and admiration
of Mars as it *is*. Sax's argument is predictably life-centric:

> The beauty of Mars exists in the human mind.... Without the human presence it
is just a collection of atoms, no different than any other random speck of
matter in the universe. It's we who understand it, and we who give it
meaning.... That's what makes Mars beautiful. Not the basalt and the oxides.

> ...And yet the whole meaning of the universe, its beauty, is contained in
the consciousness of intelligent life. We are the consciousness of the
universe, and our job is to spread that around, to go look at things, to live
everywhere we can. It's too dangerous to keep the consciousness of the universe
on only one planet, it could be wiped out. ...If there are lakes, or forests,
or glaciers, how does that diminish Mars's beauty? I don't think it does. I
think it only enhances it. It adds life, the most beautiful system of all.

Ann's response is curt.

> I think you value consciousness too high, and rock too little. We are not
lords of the universe. We're one small part of it. We may be its consciousness,
but being the consciousness of the universe does not mean turning it all into a
mirror image of us. It means rather fitting into it as it is, and worshiping it
with our attention. ...You've never even seen Mars.

Neither the argument for nor against environmental transformation is given a
definitively privileged position in the trilogy, which is clearly much more
interested in the tension between them. While Sax's ultimately carries the day,
it is also clear that his perspective is in more danger of being complicit with
capitalist exploitation of human and environment alike by transnational
corporations, dubbed the "transnats." Unlike on Earth, where intentional
environmental alterations are usually made to better access resources, the
pro-transformation argument on Mars is most directly committed to the
propagation of a healthy ecosystem. In contrast, the anti-transformation
argument, which on Earth is framed as promoting a healthy ecosystem, precludes
any ecosystem at all in the Martian context. The Promethean argument is turned
inside out: it is no longer meaningful to speak of human technologies
dominating nonhuman life when technological intervention is necessary for
nonhuman life to flourish.  Where "nature" fits into this argument becomes a
very complicated question indeed, but it is at least as much what the colonists
make room for as what they draw from. It is just as certainly not subsumed by
markets, as "growth" has reverted to its original meaning, referring to
bacteria instead of GDP.

Taken up and brought back to Earth, these questions force us to reconsider what
a "green" technology might look like, and how it might be defined. Thus far,
technologies dubbed "green" minimize impact, defined as "environmentally
friendly" in the degree to which they limit their transformation of the
environment around them. And rightly so when a healthy global ecology exists,
as under these conditions limiting transformation is indeed coextensive with
promoting nonhuman life. One would be hard pressed to find reputable ecologists
willing to describe the Earth's global ecology as "healthy" in 2016, however,
so some sort of additional consideration is called for. The dead planet is a
particularly useful figure on a dying planet for this reason---not only as a
cautionary tale, but also as a space to think through our approach to the parts
we have already killed. 

If we grant that there is nothing theoretically impossible about a technology
that is both transformative and proponent of a more robust ecosystem, we might
start considering whether a "positive" green technology, one that makes changes
for the better in addition to limiting changes for the worse, can and should be
pursued on Earth. It would not be a matter of "improving on nature" (another
charge sometimes leveled at technology instead of Prometheanism), but of
creating the conditions in which "unimproved" nature can best flourish.

Robinson invites us to consider this time and again in his terraformation
novels, as his extraterrestrial expats arrive on Terra only to realize that
Terra itself has come to need terraformation. Indeed, *Aurora*, written two
decades later, can almost be read as a response to potential misappropriations
of the Mars Trilogy that would cite terraformation as an alternative to taking
care of the Earth. The novel chastises expansionist views that would take the
fantasy of going somewhere else as permission to forget about the planet of
one's origin, to which he repeatedly suggests one is inextricably bound. In
several cases (*2312*, *Aurora*) Robinson's terraformers participate in some
form of large-scale ecological restoration on Earth combined with the
differently challenging, intellectual work of adapting their ecological
consciousness. These projects do not result in a perfect reconstruction of some
Edenic, pre-human state; the flooded landscapes that host them make this
impossible. Nevertheless these Terran ecological restoration projects look
promising, and their promise relies on an ability to deploy on their home soil
the technologies and knowledge developed for extraterrestrial
terraformation---not to mention a version of environmental praxis that combines
technological innovation with ecological thinking. 

Among the most notable aspects of this reworked, anti-Promethean vision of
technology is the space it creates for the development of an ecotopian
imaginary. If it is permissible to consider large-scale transformation of
lifeless or dying environments in order to promote the (re)generation of
nonhuman life there, some positive vision of what is technically possible and
ecologically desirable will be required. It is essential to condemn simple
greenwashing of actually Promethean approaches to technology, to oppose
technological fixes that take unconscionable risks with human and nonhuman
life, and to recognize that "transformation" can just be unfettered economic
growth in a flimsy disguise---the Reds (Earthling and Martian) are right about
that. But it is also worth asking if (and when, and how) it is possible
repurpose the means of destruction that have been unleashed on *this*
environment to help it begin repairing itself, even if the technologies that
are appropriated were developed with solely economic growth in mind. Robinson
seems to think it might be, even where doing so won't keep things as they are
or return things to precisely how they were. If he's wrong, fine---he remains a
utopian. But if he's right, he makes the space for some ecologist who "fixes
things by thinking about them" to make quite a difference indeed.
