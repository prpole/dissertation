> [Throughput:] A measure of a computerâ€™s overall performance, as measured by
its capability to send data through all components of the system, including
data storage devices such as disk drives.... In modems, the rate at which data
moves from one modem to another.... (Webster's New World Computer Dictionary)

> [Throughput:] Output relative to input; the amount that passes through a
system from input to output. (Oxford Dictionary of Environment and
Conservation)

> ...throughput is the flow of matter and energy from nonhuman nature, through
the human economy, and back to nature as pollution. A steady-state economy
would use the lowest possible levels of materials and energy in the production
phase and emit the least possible pollution in the consumption phase. (Carolyn
Merchant, *Radical Ecologies*)

Almost a thousand people stand on Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in our
solar system, and watch as an ice asteroid leaves a flaming streak in the newly
minted Martian atmosphere. The asteroid has been commandeered by UN-approved
robotic ships that have landed, burrowed themselves into a secure purchase, and
converted the material of the asteroid itself into the fuel necessary to alter
its trajectory for this calculated near miss. The assembled crowd aren't in it
for the fireworks, though. They are a thousand among many Earth expats who have
undertaken every project conceivable to turn Mars into a surrogate for the
planet they've allowed to be destroyed. 

By the end of *Red Mars*, Kim Stanley Robinson's Nebula Award-winning novel
that begins his trilogy of terraformation, we have witnessed atmospheric
alterations as modest as the cultivation of ever-hardier bacteria to those as
audacious as drilling "moholes" through the Martian crust to tap the heat at
its core. By the end of the third book (*Blue Mars*), a third generation of
humans native to Mars lounge on the beach of a Martian ocean. But just as
important to the novel's mission are its economic, legal, political, and social
innovations. The creation of an atmosphere can only happen simultaneously with
the challenge of what a Martian constitution will look like, or, more relevant
to my purposes, of adapting Earth-based understandings of environmental
activism to a planet without a biosphere. 

"Science fiction" and "sustainability" seem just about made for each other:
both are vexed terms, and both take on arguably too much. The most serious
examples of both require us to think through the intersections of technology,
ecology, sociopolitical systems, and even the ontological status of the human.
At the intersection of these two fields, Robinson uses the space of the "dead"
planet as a laboratory for social-ecological experiments, both testing the
limits of our environmental concepts and imagining the possibilities of human
development without the constraints of Earth's particular biosphere. I want to
isolate one product of this experimentation in particular for discussion here,
namely, the role of technology in what we might call the "ecotopian
imagination." But in the spirit of Robinson's own experimentation, I want to
stage this discussion in the context of the multifaceted concept of
"throughput," a term increasingly important to ecological economics and social
ecology, but which also has unexamined relevance in discussions of technology. 

***

Before I can talk about Robinson's experiments with technology and
environmental change, I have to introduce this protean term "throughput" that
sits at the crux of technology, ecology, and economics. In a sense, the term is
useful less in itself than as a point where these three fields come together.

Definitions of the term proliferate, in part because of its basic simplicity.
The shared ground of these definitions can be defined as follows: compare what
goes in to what comes out, either in terms of quantity or time, and use that
ratio to measure whatever happens in between. The variation occurs in the
specific inputs, outputs, and "whatever happens in between"---and these
elements are where it gets complicated. 

Technologically speaking, the term seems hard to get excited about, a
relatively simple metric akin to something like "horsepower" in a car. Someone
interested in communication networks would talk about the rate of data transfer
from point to point, as when the Webster Computer Dictionary defines it as data
transfer between storage devices or "from one modem to another." But, as usual,
introducing a human to the equation complicates things, as, for example, in the
amount of time it takes a computer to process inputs and respond with an
appropriate output. This "lag" between input and output was recently dramatized
in TV's *Halt and Catch Fire*[^ln_halt] as the "Doherty Threshold," an ideal
response time of less than 400ms, which is based loosely on an IBM document
from 1982 mapping savings directly to miliseconds of lag (and therefore, we
might say, information throughput from user to computer).[^ln_doherty] The
question of the user will come up again when discussing the Mars Trilogy, but
in its most basic form, information throughput's inputs and outputs are of the
same order, information rendered as bits on a storage device.

A purely ecological version of throughput is similarly modest, measuring the
amount of energy or physical matter that passes through an ecological system.
These material flows are determined by regional ecologies and the human systems
of production that cut across them and alter them. Inputs into an ecological
system include solar energy as well as human and nonhuman effluents that enter
and modify the ecological system. Here, too, the inputs and outputs are the
same: matter and energy. Introducing "information" into this system would be
meaningless, just as the materiality of the storage device is merely a matter
of hardware. 

But in ecological economics, the term has gained an importance that it doesn't
have in other fields, largely because it is able to deal with the hybridity
this field demands. When throughput gets any more complicated than it is in
computation and ecology---that is, if there is more variation between inputs,
outputs, and "whatever happens in between"---the term can introduce a certain
amount of slippage between systems that we imagine to be neatly separated.
Carolyn Merchant, for example, provides a definition of throughput that is
catered to social ecology (that hybrid of hybrids), in which material and
conceptual transformations occur every step of the way. The input "of matter
and energy" is imagined as *always* coming from nonhuman nature, "whatever
happens in between" is designated as the human economy, and the output, what
returns to the system, is always pollution, which can be materially similar to
the inputs but is conceptually distinct, all the "nature" and neutral
ecological value stripped away. Though imagined as a single "system," the
process of throughput in ecological economics is actually marked by distinct
conceptual systems from start to finish.

It is not just that these systems are distinct that makes the
ecological-economic version of throughput so difficult, but rather that each
system (economics, ecology) is largely ignorant of those on either side of
it---hence the necessity of the hybrid discipline. The challenge in reconciling
these two definitions of "throughput" is to overcome a fundamental
incommensurability in their terms. To the human economy, nonhuman nature is a
positive externality, understood in the capitalist imagination as the "free
gifts of nature" (to adopt Marx's phrasing), where "free" can be translated as
'without economic existence.' It isn't "matter and energy" that flow, but
value, and the increase in value follows no known laws of constraint within a
purely economic system. Similarly, without a legal apparatus to make it so,
pollution is merely what is expelled from the economic system as
without-economic-meaning. But from the other side, looking purely from the
vantage point of material flows, there is just no such thing as a human
economy. Exchange value is notoriously immaterial, setting aside any material
properties except insofar as they exist in the mind of the parties performing
the exchange. And yet somehow, despite this mutual incommensurability, the
inputs and outputs end up always as material flows in the social-ecological
reckoning, rendering the abstract human sphere of "whatever happens in between"
all the more mysterious.

Something is needed to think through of each of these steps in the
social-ecological balance sheet. I propose that it is a neglected middle-term,
technology, which exists as a translator between abstract and material forms of
throughput. But "technology" requires its own broad categories: our
twenty-first-century data bias might cause us to think of technology solely in
terms of the communication-network definition of throughput, namely, data
transfer from one entity to another; but we have to also recognize that what
matters most to material flows are what might be classified material or
industrial technologies. Such technologies translate the material and energy of
nonhuman natures into pollution, yes, but also into more meaningful alterations
to the *oikos*. In other words, we need to think of throughput as in some way
recursive, with outputs that change not only the next round of inputs but also
"whatever happens in between." 

***

This distinction between communication and material technologies, however,
leaves us with a fundamental problem: how to reconcile conceptual and material
systems in a way that lets us see the transformations inherent to social
ecology more fully. I want to address an example of slippage between
information throughput and material throughput that is explicitly concerned
with social ecology: robotic industrial technologies in Kim Stanley Robinson's
*Mars Trilogy*. Industrial robotics create an interface between material and
information: programmed commands, which are merely particularly structured acts
of communication, become coextensive with the  material transformations they
cause. Such technologies bridge the assumed gap between environment and our
understanding of environment, decreasing the distance between thought and
matter, human and environment. 

This should sound like rank Prometheanism, or that "nature" is something to be
conquered by human ingenuity and ever-more-developed tools. But the dead
environment of Mars makes the relevance of nonhuman natures dubious at best,
forcing us to reconsider the place of technology in ecological thinking. To put
it simply, Robinson challenges us to go beyond Prometheanism in our thinking
about nature and technology.

computing in the early 1980s. In the show's fourth episode, breaking the
Doherty Threshold is taken as a major benchmark of their impending success.
