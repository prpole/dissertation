title: Throughput, or, Gestures Beyond Prometheanism

> [Throughput:] A measure of a computerâ€™s overall performance, as measured by
its capability to send data through all components of the system, including
data storage devices such as disk drives.... In modems, the rate at which data
moves from one modem to another.... (Webster's New World Computer Dictionary)

> [Throughput:] Output relative to input; the amount that passes through a
system from input to output. (Oxford Dictionary of Environment and
Conservation)

> ...throughput is the flow of matter and energy from nonhuman nature, through
the human economy, and back to nature as pollution. A steady-state economy
would use the lowest possible levels of materials and energy in the production
phase and emit the least possible pollution in the consumption phase. (Carolyn
Merchant, *Radical Ecologies*)

Almost a thousand people stand on Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in our
solar system, and watch as an ice asteroid leaves a flaming streak in the newly
minted Martian atmosphere. The asteroid has been commandeered by UN-approved
robotic ships that have landed, burrowed themselves into a secure purchase, and
converted the material of the asteroid itself into the fuel necessary to alter
its trajectory for this calculated near miss. The assembled crowd aren't in it
for the fireworks, though. They are a thousand among many Earth expats who have
undertaken every project conceivable to turn Mars into a surrogate for the
planet they've allowed to be destroyed. 

By the end of *Red Mars*, Kim Stanley Robinson's Nebula Award-winning novel
that begins his trilogy of terraformation, we have witnessed atmospheric
alterations as modest as the cultivation of ever-hardier bacteria to those as
audacious as drilling "moholes" through the Martian crust to tap the heat at
its core. By the end of the third book (*Blue Mars*), a third generation of
humans native to Mars lounge on the beach of a Martian ocean. But just as
important to the novel's mission are its economic, legal, political, and social
innovations. The creation of an atmosphere can only happen simultaneously with
the challenge of what a Martian constitution will look like, or, more relevant
to my purposes, of adapting Earth-based understandings of environmental
activism to a planet without a biosphere. 

"Science fiction" and "sustainability" seem just about made for each other:
both are vexed terms, and both take on arguably too much. The most serious
examples of both require us to think through the intersections of technology,
ecology, sociopolitical systems, and even the ontological status of the human.
At the intersection of these two fields, Robinson uses the space of the "dead"
planet as a laboratory for social-ecological experiments, both testing the
limits of our environmental concepts and imagining the possibilities of human
development without the constraints of Earth's particular biosphere. I want to
isolate one product of this experimentation in particular for discussion here,
namely, the role of technology in what we might call the ecotopian imagination.
But in the spirit of his experimentation, I want to stage this discussion in
the context of the multifaceted concept of "throughput," a term increasingly
important to ecological economics and social ecology, but which also has
unexamined relevance in discussions of technology. 

***

Definitions of "throughput" proliferate, in part because of its basic
simplicity: compare what goes in to what comes out, either in terms of quantity
or time, and use that ratio to measure whatever happens in between. The
variation occurs in the specific inputs, outputs, and "whatever happens in
between"---and these elements are where it gets complicated. 

Someone interested in communication networks would talk about the rate of data
transfer from point to point. They would probably mean something like the
Webster Computer Dictionary's "from one modem to another," but we can imagine a
version that includes humans. (What was the information throughput of my email?
Did you understand that I'm upset?) The inputs and outputs are the same: data,
carried across some sort of medium.

An ecological version of throughput might measure the amount of energy or some
other material metric moving through an *ecological* system from start to
finish. These material flows are determined by regional ecologies and the human
systems of production that cut across them and alter them. The ultimate input
into an ecological system is solar energy, but human and nonhuman effluents
that enter and modify the ecological system also introduce energy to the system
through other means. Here, too, the inputs and outputs are the same: matter and
energy. Introducing "information" into this system would be meaningless, just
as the materiality of the information network is mere "hardware." 

But if throughput gets any more complicated---that is, if there is more
material differentiation between inputs, outputs, and "whatever happens in
between"---the term can introduce a certain amount of slippage between systems
that we imagine to be neatly separated. Carolyn Merchant, for example, provides
a definition of throughput that is catered to social ecology (that hybrid of
hybrids), in which material and conceptual transformations occur every step of
the way. The input "of matter and energy" is imagined as *always* coming from
nonhuman nature, "whatever happens in between" is designated as the human
economy, and the output, what returns to the system, is always pollution.
Though imagined as a single "system," the process is actually marked by
distinct conceptual systems from start to finish, each largely ignorant of
those on either side of it. 

The challenge in reconciling these two definitions of "throughput" is to
overcome a fundamental incommensurability in their terms. To the human economy,
nonhuman nature is a positive externality, understood in the capitalist
imagination as the "free gifts of nature" (to adopt Marx's phrasing), where
"free" can be translated as 'without economic existence.' It isn't "matter and
energy" that flow, but value, and the increase in value follows no known laws
of constraint within a purely economic system. Similarly, without a legal
apparatus to make it so, pollution is merely what is expelled from the economic
system as without-economic-meaning. But from the other side, looking purely
from the vantage point of material flows, there is just no such thing as a
human economy. Exchange value is notoriously immaterial, setting aside any
material properties except insofar as they exist in the mind of the parties
performing the exchange. And yet somehow, despite this mutual
incommensurability, the inputs and outputs end up always as material flows in
the social-ecological reckoning, rendering the abstract sphere of "whatever
happens in between" all the more mysterious.

Something is needed to think through of each of these steps in the
social-ecological balance sheet. I propose that it is a neglected middle-term,
technology, which exists as a translator between abstract and material forms of
throughput. But "technology" requires its own broad categories: our
twenty-first-century data bias might cause us to think of technology solely in
terms of the communication-network definition of throughput, namely, data
transfer from one entity to another; but we have to also recognize that what
matters most to material flows are what might be classified material or
industrial technologies. Such technologies translate the material and energy of
nonhuman natures into pollution, yes, but also into more meaningful alterations
to the *oikos*. In other words, we need to think of throughput as in some way
recursive, with outputs that change not only the next round of inputs but also
"whatever happens in between." 

***

This distinction between communication and material technologies, however,
leaves us with a fundamental problem: how to reconcile conceptual and material
systems in a way that lets us see the transformations inherent to social
ecology more fully. I want to address an example of slippage between
information throughput and material throughput that is explicitly concerned
with social ecology: robotic industrial technologies in Kim Stanley Robinson's
*Mars Trilogy*. Industrial robotics create an interface between material and
information: programmed commands, which are merely particularly structured acts
of communication, become coextensive with the  material transformations they
cause. Such technologies bridge the assumed gap between environment and our
understanding of environment, decreasing the distance between thought and
matter, human and environment. 

This should sound like rank Prometheanism, or that "nature" is something to be
conquered by human ingenuity and ever-more-developed tools. But the dead
environment of Mars makes the relevance of nonhuman natures dubious at best,
forcing us to reconsider the place of technology in ecological thinking. To put
it simply, Robinson challenges us to go beyond Prometheanism in our thinking
about nature and technology.
