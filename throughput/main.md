> [Throughput:] A measure of a computerâ€™s overall performance, as measured by
its capability to send data through all components of the system, including
data storage devices such as disk drives.... In modems, the rate at which data
moves from one modem to another.... (Webster's New World Computer Dictionary)

> [Throughput:] Output relative to input; the amount that passes through a
system from input to output. (Oxford Dictionary of Environment and
Conservation)

> ...throughput is the flow of matter and energy from nonhuman nature, through
the human economy, and back to nature as pollution. A steady-state economy
would use the lowest possible levels of materials and energy in the production
phase and emit the least possible pollution in the consumption phase. (Carolyn
Merchant, *Radical Ecologies*)

Almost a thousand people stand on Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in our
solar system, and watch as an ice asteroid leaves a gash in the newly minted
Martian atmosphere. The asteroid has been commandeered by UN-approved robotic
ships that have landed, burrowed themselves into a secure purchase, and
converted the material of the asteroid itself into the fuel necessary to alter
its trajectory for this calculated near miss. The assembled crowd aren't in it
for the fireworks, though. They are a thousand among many Earth expats who have
undertaken every project conceivable to turn Mars into a surrogate for the
planet they've allowed to be destroyed. 

By the end of *Red Mars*, Kim Stanley Robinson's Nebula Award-winning novel
that begins his trilogy of terraformation, we have witnessed atmospheric
alterations as modest as the cultivation of ever-hardier bacteria to those as
audacious as drilling "moholes" through the Martian crust to tap the heat at
its core. By the end of the third book (*Blue Mars*), a third generation of
humans native to Mars lounge on the beach of a Martian ocean. But just as
important to the novel's mission are its economic, political, and social
innovations. The creation of an atmosphere can only happen simultaneously with
the challenge of what a Martian constitution will look like, or, more relevant
to my purposes, of adapting Earth-based understandings of environmental
activism to a planet without a biosphere. 

"Science fiction" and "sustainability" seem just about made for each other:
both are vexed terms, and both take on arguably too much. The most serious
examples of both require us to think through the intersections of technology,
ecology, sociopolitical systems, and even the ontological status of the human.
At the intersection of these two fields, Robinson uses the space of the "dead"
planet as a laboratory for social-ecological experiments, both testing the
limits of our environmental concepts and imagining the possibilities of human
development without the constraints of Earth's particular biosphere. I want to
isolate one product of this experimentation in particular for discussion here,
namely, the role of technology in what we might call the "ecotopian
imagination." [But in the spirit of Robinson's own experimentation, I want to
stage this discussion in the context of the multifaceted concept of
"throughput," a term increasingly important to ecological economics and social
ecology, but which also has unexamined relevance in discussions of technology.]

"Robotics" in Robinson's hands looks considerably different from the more
famous version associated with, say, Isaac Asimov---humanoid robots whose goal
is to serve in the way humans serve, and whose fictional instantiations are
usually taken as proxies for class struggle or enslavement.[^ln-robot-slaves]
In much of Robinson's work, robots appear in the form of mobile industrial
machinery that places an unfathomable transformative power in the hands of the
programmer. This vision of industrial robotics creates an interface between
materiality and information: programmed commands, which are merely particularly
structured acts of communication, become coextensive with the material
transformations they cause. Thus, Robinson's robotic manufacturing technologies
bridge the assumed gap between environment and our understanding of environment
by decreasing the distance between communication and transformative
action---or, to translate, between structures in the mind and structures in
matter. 

We never get to see what this interface looks like precisely, but it can be
inferred that it combines high-level human input with intelligent automation.
From start to finish, the information being transferred is emphatically *not*
where to place each plunge of the drill, but rather the transfer of a human
user's construction plan to the machine. As is required for "intelligence" in
any artificial system, the details are determined by the robot receiving and
interpreting feedback from the material reality it encounters. The result is
that "creation" and transformation are merely a matter of communicating some
feasible thing one wants to happen in a structured way the robot can
understand. The actual labor is reduced to making a good plan and figuring out
how to relate it. In this particular industrial army, to put it another way,
everyone is a general. 

One example of this process has already been presented---the robot landers that
capture an ice asteroid and bring it into the Martian atmosphere. Very little
of this process is seen of that in the novel itself. One of the more explicit
examples of how this form of technology actually works comes in a moment of
crisis near the end of *Red Mars*. Someone sabotages a water station near a
major town that taps into a large aquifer, and the hydrostatic pressure beneath
the surface of the planet threatens a catastrophic explosion that would create
the first Martian ocean where the town used to be. Any hope of preventing this
relies on their ability to collapse an overhanging cliff face onto the site of
the break to contain the pressure and plug up the hole---and to do so within a
matter of hours. Nadia, a character particularly occupied with construction,
takes over:

> During the ride over she had directed all the town's construction robots from
their hangar to the foot of the north wall, next to the water station; when the
two rovers got there, they found a few of the faster robots had already
arrived, and the rest were grinding over the canyon floor toward them. There
was a small talus slope at the foot of the cliff.... Nadia linked into the
earthmovers and bulldozers and gave them instructions to clear paths toward the
talus; when that was done, tunnelers would bore straight into the cliff.... The
slower robots arrived, bringing an array of explosives left over from the
excavation of the town's foundation. Nadia went to work programming the
vehicles to tunnel into the bottom of the cliff, and for most of an hour she
was lost to the world.

One of the more detailed acts of "construction" in the novel, this moment is a
particularly telling portrait of what human labor looks like on Robinson's
Mars. If we want to know what Nadia actually does, we can just look at the verb
phrases of which she is the subject. By the time the cliff is brought down,
Nadia has "directed," "linked into," and spent several hours "programming," all
of which can be summed up by the phrase "gave them [the robots] instructions."
Meanwhile, the robots were "grinding" out their efforts "to clear paths," "bore
straight into the cliff," and thereby "tunnel" their way to Nadia's intended
result. Comparing the sets of verbs, the division of labor is clear: Nadia does
the thinking, the robots do the work. 

No surprises there. But it's important to note that the robots are more
intelligent than mere tools. The ability to "clear a path," imagined from a
programmer's perspective like Nadia's, would require an ability to take in and
synthesize feedback (in this case, debris) encountered along the way, freeing
the programmer from the necessity of accounting for each rock along the way, as
she would in, say, a bulldozer. The division of labor Robinson imagines
therefore relies on networks of communication for the transmission of
instructions and complex intelligent systems to allow those instructions to
stay on a high level of abstraction, excluding the minutiae of each
step.[^ln-loa] This latter point is important, because maintaining a high level
of abstraction in communicating instructions to a machine keeps those
instructions in the language of the human imagination. As readers of these
moments in Robinson's fiction, we come to assume any concrete transformation to
the environment that can be imagined can be made to happen because the language
of action and imagination are kept on the same plane. 

Though this particularly violent moment of transformation is useful in
revealing the narrative mechanism of thought and transformation, in most ways
it is anomalous. Moments of crisis-aversion like this are few and discrete,
whereas patient construction is continuous and defines the trilogy. The same
methods that Nadia uses to plug up the punctured aquifer are used by all of the
first hundred colonists to build their settlements and pursue their
terraformation efforts. Communal shelters are built out of bricks from
automated "brick factories," which are set up to convert the materials at hand
in the inorganic rock surface of the planet (the regolith) into a usable form.
Most exciting (if also most improbable) is the ability "to construct soil just
like they had...magnesium bars" by converting leftover nitrogen into
fertilizers that can be mixed with the rocky regolith, supplementing soil
brought from Earth along with the organic material of greenhouses with these
human-produced mixtures. This process, too, entails communicating the plan for
constructing soil to a series of robots, now in the form of factories. But it
is not a matter of pounding rock slurry into particularly useful shapes or
collapsing geographical structures. It is the quiet work of creating the
foundations for life, work that is usually automated but not intelligent, the
product of millennia of material flows. It is, in other words, the literal
construction of nature.

To summarize, then, these semi-intelligent industrial robots allow for the
translation of imagined environments into material environments, establishing
technology as an interface between an individual utopian imaginary and material
praxis. But because these utopian imaginaries are concerned with the
circulation of energy and physical material in an ecological system (however
nascent), we have to rephrase this equation: technology is an interface between
an individual *ecotopian* imaginary and *environmental* praxis. 

For this translation to work narratively, the industrial robots have to be
programmable in a relatively short amount of time by a single person. These
features create the conduit between plan and reality, allowing us to
imaginatively short circuit the robotic laborers and suppose that "thinking
makes it so." Eliding the grittier engineering problems is a recurring fantasy
in Robinson's work, even if he never loses sight of the material constraints
his characters face. It is a fantasy that is most clearly expressed in his most
recent novel, *Aurora* (2015). Admiring a particularly adept engineer, one
character exclaims: "So she fixes things by thinking about them!" What is
"fixed" in the Mars Trilogy is most often the inability of the atmosphere to
support life.

Breaking the barrier between human thought and environment, unlimited powers of
environmental transformation---all of this should sound like rank
Prometheanism, or the (often implicit) view that "nature" is something to be
conquered by science, human ingenuity, and ever-more-developed tools. At the
very least, it is anthropocentric. The measure of a suitable environment is its
usefulness to this invasive species, the human. Not to mention that the vast
determining power put in the hands of an individual organism seems anathemic to
anything approaching ecology, in which, as a fundamental tenet, everything
affects everything in a complex web of interconnections. It's hard to imagine a
deep ecologist being very excited about any of these ideas.

But what would a deep ecologist do without an ecology? The dead environment of
Mars makes the relevance of concern for nonhuman natures dubious at best, and
it forces us to ask some difficult questions about what the goals of
environmental activism ultimately are on any planet---a question with clear
implications for the environmental ethics of technology. Robinson stages this
debate by embodying it in distinct characters, political affiliations, and
ideologies that can be summed up as a debate between the "reds" and the
"greens." Though this split might mean communist or environmentalist on Earth,
on Mars it indicates one's support either for the maintenance of Mars in an
untouched state or for the propagation of life and a robust ecology. It is a
question that we simply have no need to pose without Mars or a planet like it,
because on Earth there is no difference between these two goals. Introducing
the Martian environment into the discussion, though, forces us to ask: is it
limiting human impact (full stop) that we care about when we talk about
conservation? Or do we care about limiting human impact only insofar as it
limits the propagation of nonhuman life? And which *should* we care about?

Perhaps for tactical reasons, conservationism on Earth usually leans heavily on
the destruction of life as the reason to care about human influence on the
ecology---and in too many cases, only on the destruction of life that we like
the look of. But without life, conservation gives way as a framework to the
question of whether purposive human determination of its environment is
fundamentally unethical or distasteful. The debate plays out in Robinson's
novel most explicitly between Sax (Saxifrage Russel, whose namesake is, to
William Carlos Williams, "my flower that splits / rocks") and Ann Clayborne
(whose surname seems to imply that she is the rock to be split). Sax is the
main proponent of terraformation by any means necessary, while Ann advocates
minimizing human impact in order to promote study of Mars as it *is*. Sax's
argument is predictably life-centric:

> The beauty of Mars exists in the human mind.... Without the human presence it
is just a collection of atoms, no different than any other random speck of
matter in the universe. It's we who understand it, and we who give it
meaning.... That's what makes Mars beautiful. Not the basalt and the oxides.
    ...And yet the whole meaning of the universe, its beauty, is contained in
the consciousness of intelligent life. We are the consciousness of the
universe, and our job is to spread that around, to go look at things, to
live everywhere we can. It's too dangerous to keep the consciousness of the
universe on only one planet, it could be wiped out. ...[I]t can be Mars and
ours at the same time. And it will be. There is this about the human mind: if
it can be done, it will be done. We can transform Mars and build it like you
would build a cathedral, as a monument to humanity and the universe both.

Ann's response is curt.

> I think you value consciousness too high, and rock too little. We are not
lords of the universe. We're one small part of it. We may be its consciousness,
but being the consciousness of the universe does not mean turning it all into a
mirror image of us. It means rather fitting into it as it is, and worshiping it
with our attention. ...You've never even seen Mars.

Neither argument is given a definitively privileged position in the trilogy.
Even if Sax's ultimately carries the day, it is also clear that his perspective
is in more danger of being complicit with capitalist exploitation of human and
environment alike (by transnational corporations, or the "transnats").

place of technology in ecological thinking. To put it simply, Robinson
challenges us to go beyond Prometheanism in our thinking about nature and
technology.
