title: Throughput, or, Beyond Prometheanism
---

> A measure of a computerâ€™s overall performance, as measured by its capability
to send data through all components of the system, including data storage
devices such as disk drives.... In modems, the rate at which data moves from
one modem to another.... (Webster's New World Computer Dictionary)

> Output relative to input; the amount [of *something*] that passes through a
system from input to output. (Oxford Dictionary of Environment and
Conservation)

> ...throughput is the flow of matter and energy from nonhuman nature, through
the human economy, and back to nature as pollution. A steady-state economy
would use the lowest possible levels of materials and energy in the production
phase and emit the least possible pollution in the consumption phase. (Carolyn
Merchant, *Radical Ecologies*)

Definitions of "throughput" proliferate, in part because of its basic
simplicity: compare what goes in to what comes out, either in terms of quantity
or time, and use that ratio to measure whatever happens in between. The
variation happens in inputs, outputs, and "whatever happens in between"---and
these elements are where it gets complicated. Someone interested in
communication networks would talk about the rate of data transfer from point to
point. They would probably mean something like the Webster Computer
Dictionary's "from one modem to another," but we can imagine a version that
includes humans. (What was the information throughput of my email? Did you
understand that I'm upset?) An ecological version of throughput might measure
the amount of energy or some other material metric moving through an
*ecological* system from start to finish. The only input, finally, is solar
energy, although human and nonhuman effluents, themselves ultimately the
products of solar energy, would also introduce energy to the system through
other means.

But if throughput gets any more complicated---that is, if there is more
material differentiation between inputs, outputs, and "whatever happens in
between"---the term can introduce a certain amount of slippage between systems
that we imagine to be neatly separated. Carolyn Merchant, for example, provides
a definition catered to social ecology, in which the input "of matter and
energy" is imagined as *always* coming from nonhuman nature, "whatever happens
in between" is designated as the human economy, and the output, what returns to
the system, is always pollution. Though imagined as a single "system," the
process is actually marked by distinct conceptual systems from start to finish,
each largely ignorant of those on either side of it. To the human economy,
nonhuman nature is a positive externality, understood in the capitalist
imagination (as Marx put it) as the "free gifts of nature." It isn't "matter
and energy" that flow, but value, and the increase in value follows no known
laws of constraint within a purely economic system. Similarly, without a legal
apparatus to make it so, pollution is merely what is expelled from the economic
system as without-value, and therefore, without existence. But from the other
side, looking purely from the vantage point of material flows, there is just no
such thing as a human economy. Exchange value is notoriously immaterial,
setting aside any material properties except insofar as they exist in the mind
of the parties performing the exchange. And yet somehow, despite this mutual
incommunicability, the inputs and outputs end up always as material flows in
the social-ecological reckoning, rendering the abstract sphere of "whatever
happens in between" all the more mysterious.

Something is needed to think through of each of these steps in terms of its
fellows. I propose that it is a neglected middle-term, technology, which exists
as a translator between abstract and material forms of throughput. Our
twenty-first century data bias might cause us to think of technology solely in
terms of the communication-network definition of throughput, namely, data
transfer from one entity to another. But we have to also recognize that what
matters most to material flows are what might be classified material or
industrial technologies, which translate material derived from nonhuman natures
into pollution, yes, but also product. 

This distinction, however, leaves the fundamental problem of how to reconcile
conceptual and material systems in a way that lets us see the transformations
of inherent to social ecology more fully. I want to address an example of
slippage between information throughput and material throughput that is
explicitly concerned with social ecology: robotic industrial technologies in
Kim Stanley Robinson's *Mars Trilogy*. Industrial robotics create an interface
between material and information through programmed commands that become
enacted as material transformations. Such technologies bridge the assumed gap
between environment and our understanding of environment, decreasing the
distance between thought and matter. This should sound like rank Prometheanism,
or the conception of "nature" as something to be conquered. But the dead
environment of Mars makes the relevanc of nonhuman natures dubious at best,
forcing us to reconsider the place of technology in ecological thinking. To put
it simply, Robinson challenges us to go beyond Prometheanism in our thinking
about nature and technology.
