Definition?: the view that an organism's environment is the sole or primary
determining factor in its evolution and behavior. 

Livingstone: there is a return to climatic versions of environmental

Environmental determinism versus ecological embeddedness?

    - the former has a long history of association with pseudo-speciation
    explanations of race and the question of whether white humans could flourish in
    the environments they were colonizing
    - ecological embeddedness would be a slightly anachronistic term to
describe naturalism; the more common term in naturalism studies is determinism
    - but e.e. has more explicit environmentalist
