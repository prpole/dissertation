Misc London note, for revision:

something like: "The purpose of this chapter is twofold. First, to show that London's version of the Anthropos is indelibly bound up with his belief that the races were in the midst of a global battle for supremacy, even---and perhaps especially---in agricultural contexts. Such a correspondence gives credence to suspicion of the Anthropos as a unifying political or identity concept. At the same time, however, it is possible to read against the grain of his depictions of racialized agriculture to discover a [better] version of the Anthropos, one based on pluralism and cultural exchange that envisions an unprecedented role for the human as a proponent of ever-more-abundant life on Earth."

Tsu, Cicila M. "Garden of the World: Asian Immigrants and the Making of Agriculture in California's Santa Clara Valley" OUP, 2013

- Cf London: "Even though many white farm owners throughout California and the American West like the Nilsons relied on Asian immigrant farmers, the cultural lore that celebrated farming as a native-born white American pursuit erased Asians altogether from the narrative of success associated with the region's orchard fruit economy." 4-5

- "The inclusion of Asians as menial itinerant agricultural workers in “inferior” crops and their exclusion as aliens unfit not only for U.S. citizenship but also American family life ultimately preserved and reproduced white supremacy and American national identity" 7

"In fact, white growers frequently found themselves adopting precarious, contradictory stances on the issue of Asian immigration, their positions reflecting their adherence to prevailing views of white superiority as well as their conflicted feelings about Asian agricultural labor." 8
