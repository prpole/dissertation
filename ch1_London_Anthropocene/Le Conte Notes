Le Conte Notes

Read Part I, Part III Chapter iv

3-4: everything is a system of correlated parts; there are two perspectives, one that points to the stability of a system and maintains equilibrium, and another (evolution) that is concerned with the progression of the system and the shifting point of equilibrium

4: "Nature as a whole is...a system of correlated parts. Every department and sub-department of Nature, whether it be the solar system or the earth, or the organic kingdom, or human society, or the human body, is such a system of correlated parts, and is therefore subject to evolution."

Ok, so LE CONTE is mechanistic; Norris is more complicated.

5: uses the human body and the egg as points of explanation for this systemic view

6: society in the same model: "we must study society also in its onward movement---the equilibrium ever disturbed, only to be readjusted on a higher plane with more and more complexly inter-related parts. This is dynamics---social progress. It is evolution."

On the earth: it "may be studied in its present forms, and the mutual actions of all its parts...This is physical geography. Or, we may study the earth in its gradual progress toward its present condition---the changes which have taken place in all these parts and consequent changes in climate; in a word, the gradual process of becoming what it now is. This is physical geology---it is evolution."

7: conceives of evolution not on the scale of the species, but the whole "organic kingdom"---the whole scala naturae

9-10: similarly to Ward and (I think?) Spencer, imagines a progress toward higher complexity over time

10-11: Note the mention of the Psychozoic era (see above): this puts together his theories of evolution and of geologic time
