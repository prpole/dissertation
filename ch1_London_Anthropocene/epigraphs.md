If it is to be more than a view from on high, however, it must be more than
that, or, perhaps more accurately, less than that; it must be less distanced,
less empyrean, and less stratospheric. It must abandon the heavens, set feet
back on the ground, and ask, whether, having caught that catastrophic glimpse
from above, we might, as Benjamin also hoped, “blast open the continuum of
history” that has produced this unfolding chain of catastrophes, so that we
might, in Malabou’s terms, render our work truly “plastique,” truly explosive
for the future. If we are to do so, then, I firmly believe, we must return
to our archive, to seek and discover in it (in addition to the concept of
freedom) the further conceptual material that will allow our studies, our
interpretive strategies, and our habits of critique to acquire a new planetary
potentiality, to indeed become a force of nature.
