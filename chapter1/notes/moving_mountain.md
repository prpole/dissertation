"We have discovered as many ways of utilizing human waste as we used to have for the waste products of coal tar."

<-- but problematically used to talk about immigration, even though she is surprisingly pro-immigration and pro-diversity here

<-- eh that didn't last long. She's talking about "compulsory socialization" and turning away the "hopeless ones"; integration has something to do with social engineering experiments


ON Eugenics and Malthusianism 

"They were beginning to talk eugenics when I left.”

“This is not eugenics—we have made great advances in that, of course; but the chief factor in this change is a common biological law—‘individuation is in inverse proportion to reproduction,’ you know. We individualize the women—develop their personal power, their human characteristics—and they don’t have so many children.”

“I don’t see how that helps unless you have eliminated the brutality of men.”

“My dear brother, the brutality of men lowered the birthrate—it didn’t raise it! One of those undifferentiated peasant women would have a baby every year if she was married to a saint—and she couldn’t have more in polyandry—unless it were twins I No, the birthrate was for women to settle—and they have.”


On clean energy!

“You’ve ended the smoke nuisance, I’m glad to see. Has steam gone, too?”

“We use electricity altogether in all the cities now,” she said. “It occurred to us that to pipe a leaking death into every bedroom; to thread the city with poison, fire and explosion, was foolish.”

“Defective wiring used to cause both death and conflagration, didn’t it?”

“It did,” she admitted; “but it is not ‘defective’ any more.”

“Is the coal all gone?”

“No, but we burn it at the mines—by a process which does not waste ninety per cent of the energy—and transmit the power.”

“For all New York?”

“Oh, no. New York has enough water power, you see. The tide mills are enough for this whole region.”

“They solved the tide-mill problem, did they?”

“Yes. There are innumerable mechanical advances, of course. You’ll enjoy them.”
