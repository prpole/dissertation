Idea: link "good anthropocene" and transition towns/transition network? Do
these mean the same thing?

## Bennett *et al*

I think so in that g.a. just appears to mean "futures in which not everything
is well and truly fucked"

Possible to gloss "good anthropocene" as an optimistic stance toward collective
action? Where collective action means a functioning global democracy and robust
international organizations without larceny in their hearts... (441)

heavy on the word "transition"---seems to be the same movement/related

Above all does not equate human participation in determining environmental
futures disastrous in all cases; yet recognizes dangers

** is it possible to consider Gilman as just a utopian articulation of the positive
anthropocentric outcome Ward imagines to be possible? I think I've already said
this, but: Gilman is in a middle place between Wardian and "good Anthropocene"
visions of the human-nature imbrication and that of the catastrophic vision of
the Anthropocene. She starts with a catastrophe that asserts the ultimate
limits (what we now call carrying capacity) to human growth/resource use, which
the Herlanders allow to be ultimate---they do not surpass it for some reason.
And yet within those ultimate limits absolute Prometheanism and Wardian
"artificial selection" reigns supreme. She imagines the possibility of
a Prometheanism that respects limits, perhaps a more Baconian position than
most of Bacon's fans tend to assume (recall Bacon: gotta obey nature to master
it)**

## Hamilton: The Theodicy of the 'Good Anthropocene'

Truly describes Ward to a tee; strong source for this connection, in
combination with Ward himself; Hamilton's term "anthropodicy" is clunky but
useful

But ecomodernism appears to conflict with Bennett et al, who condemn this kind
of wild utopianism....
