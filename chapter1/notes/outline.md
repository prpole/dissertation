New Questions
=============

Can there be a "good" Anthropocene?
------------------------------------

Elena M. Bennett

Is it possible to position Ward (and Marsh? Those like him?) as the originators
<!-- probably too far--> of the "Good Anthropocene" concept---and Gilman by extension? At least certainly the "good Anthropocene" wing of the naturalist argument.

### The Argument for Gilman as a good-Anthropocenist



Ward/Marsh
==========

- human takes over as evolutionary agent (apex, then agent)

- (climax ecology? prolly not)

- (carrying capacity? mebbe; more likely niches/geological niches)

- proto-conservation and forestry


"The exchange of ideas among these four men began with Marsh;
Marsh's work was a catalyst for Powell, and Powell was the seminal leader
for Ward and McGee. The influence of Powell and Ward on each other
is unclear. Ward did a study of the prairie grasses in the arid region for
Powell in 1875 and, since both started writing in 1869, they probably
influenced each other's opinions. Ward was Powell's favorite on the
Survey, and Powell gave Ward a position so he could finish his Dynamic
Sociology. Ward was the sole member of the Survey capable of engaging
in a philosophical discussion with Powell, and he undoubtedly helped to
persuade Powell to accept positive government as an agent in resource
management. 11 McGee worked closely with Powell and helped him de-
velop the policies of the Survey. Powell encouraged McGee in geological
hydrological and ethnological research and McGee advanced to produce
works in hydrology and geology that surpassed the work of Powell. Ward
and Powell formulated a social theory based on Darwinism and oriented
for positive democratic action, but it was McGee who applied the eco-
logical insight of the group to the main conservation efforts of the day and
brought them together in a legislative program that reflected the natural
relationships between resources." (Ross 52)
