[ something from the archives? ]

*Herland* is often read primarily for its "gynaecocentric" (?) evolutionary
theory and its vision of a society populated only of women---and understandably
so; this is the explicit centerpiece of the novel. No less central, but much
less discussed, are the novel's insights into the role of the human activity in
shaping natural systems. The Herland environment is marked by benign but
absolute human control over the natural environment. While there is very little
agriculture or cultivation in the traditional sense, Herlanders have chosen to
retain and support certain elements of the ecosystem while systematically
exterminating others, producing a food-production system that is more
reminiscent of permaculture than any of the prevailing horticultural models of
the time. 

There is none of the contradiction between production and
reproduction that has marked the twentieth century [Merchant ???], because
production has been totally subsumed by reproduction for all the organisms in
the ecological system, from the smallest organisms to the humans. 

## outline-ish

1. intro

    a. set up Gilman/Ward as acknowledging the Anthropocene while attempting to
assert it as the rightful order---if only best practices are followed; buttress
with Blackwell

    b. this is undeniably Anthropocenic---the context of Marsh, Ward's history
with him; historically she finds herself definitely situated in the beginnings
of Anthropocene thinking, or more specifically, in one of the first
anthropocentric counterpoints to the tenets of the Anthropocene as synonymous
with apocalypse (Marsh on the end of the planet, here; context on Ward)

    c. Gilman embodies, "re-presenting" Ward (Davis), the principles of the
"good" Anthropocene, which has gained momentum as the official announcement of
the epoch grows closer. 

        i. mvmt essentially tries to figure out sustainable principles/more
invasive guidance of natural processes to make inevitable human influence of
ecosystems in which they are embedded something other than apocalyptic

        ii. we can see in Ward the roots of this movement (humanity as apex and
inheritor of evolutionary process)

        iii. in both cases such a benign guiding hand requires robust social
programs and a strong communal will to guide human influence of non-human
nature

    d. But Gilman's novella also embodies an ethical problem that is more
rarely mooted in Anthropocene discourse. She positions the human as
simultaneously the steward and of an ecosystem and a cornerstone component of
it; the changes that the human enacts (wilfully and otherwise) on the system as
a whole also alter the human. Environmental ethics become part and parcel of
human ethics, and vice versa. Artificial selection is taken to what would now
be understood as its *reductio ad absurdum*, resulting in a program of
voluntary eugenics. She demonstrates, in essence, the entanglement of two
fundamental problems: extending human ethics to non-human parts of the
ecosystem and considering the human ecologically (with all the wilful checks
and balances that implies). 

    e. We should therefore understand *Herland* as a meditation on the
embeddedness of human and natural systems, even if we have to resist its
utopian outcomes. By incorporating these disparate systems into one larger one,
she demonstrates the inseparability of politics and human ecology. Though often
naively at best---and monstrously at worst---she makes economics and ecology,
production and reproduction, and politics and planting completely coextensive.
While revealing the sustainable and environmentally progressive potential of
collective movements, she also exposes the extent to which such movements would
have to risk curtailing due process and democratic principles to achieve their
goals. Finally, she shows the potential for ecological optimism in literary
naturalism---a genre often derisively called "pessimistic realism" (Lukacs). In
thinking through these problematics (not to say resolving them), she creates
what we might refer to as a "utopian naturalism": a mobilization of the genre's
penchant for systems thinking to project speculative futures, futures that
ultimately rely on a faith in collective action. 



New Questions
=============

Can there be a "good" Anthropocene?
------------------------------------

Elena M. Bennett

Is it possible to position Ward (and Marsh? Those like him?) as the originators
<!-- probably too far--> of the "Good Anthropocene" concept---and Gilman by extension? At least certainly the "good Anthropocene" wing of the naturalist argument.

### The Argument for Gilman as a good-Anthropocenist



Ward/Marsh
==========

- human takes over as evolutionary agent (apex, then agent)

- (climax ecology? prolly not)

- (carrying capacity? mebbe; more likely niches/geological niches) < yes

- proto-conservation and forestry


"The exchange of ideas among these four men began with Marsh;
Marsh's work was a catalyst for Powell, and Powell was the seminal leader
for Ward and McGee. The influence of Powell and Ward on each other
is unclear. Ward did a study of the prairie grasses in the arid region for
Powell in 1875 and, since both started writing in 1869, they probably
influenced each other's opinions. Ward was Powell's favorite on the
Survey, and Powell gave Ward a position so he could finish his Dynamic
Sociology. Ward was the sole member of the Survey capable of engaging
in a philosophical discussion with Powell, and he undoubtedly helped to
persuade Powell to accept positive government as an agent in resource
management. 11 McGee worked closely with Powell and helped him de-
velop the policies of the Survey. Powell encouraged McGee in geological
hydrological and ethnological research and McGee advanced to produce
works in hydrology and geology that surpassed the work of Powell. Ward
and Powell formulated a social theory based on Darwinism and oriented
for positive democratic action, but it was McGee who applied the eco-
logical insight of the group to the main conservation efforts of the day and
brought them together in a legislative program that reflected the natural
relationships between resources." (Ross 52)
