[^4]: The beginning of our new geological epoch, defined by
    humanity’s ascent to the status of a geological force, will likely
    be officially marked by some combination of industrial agriculture,
    nuclear proliferation, and carbon emissions, dated sometime in the
    middle of the twentieth century.  Other proposals in the sciences
    and humanities consider major agricultural and industrial revolutions 
    as possible points from which to begin. See @zalasiewicz_anthropocene_2017 
    and @waters_anthropocene_2016.

[^5]: One critic refers to this as an “ecocritical and place-based turn”
    in Gilman scholarship over the past decade and a half. @formisano_it_2016, 72.

[^6]: @noauthor_ecomodernist_nodate. See also the roundtable in *Environmental Humanities* 7.1 responding to the Ecomoderns, especially: @crist_reaches_2015, @latour_fifty_2015, @haraway_anthropocene_2015, @szerszynski_getting_2015. The anti-capitalist critique of geoengineering, though not specifically a response to the Ecomodernists, is outlined well in @klein_this_2015.

[^9]: See especially @mitchell_determined_1989.

[^11]: Other scholars have seen this as evidence of Gilman's "reform naturalism." See @formisano_it_2016 and @scharnhorst_charlotte_1985.

[^15]: See, of course, @marx_machine_2000, as well as @chang_economics_2010 342-3. For a more
    extended treatment of the garden as a realist and naturalist motif
    in *Herland*, see @fleissner_women_2004.

[^19]: There are no indications of the exact distribution of these
    cities, but the presence of such a network is indicated during the
    men’s escape attempt and their eventual lecture circuit. @gilman_herland_2012
    70-1, 109-11.

[^30]: This understanding of the place of nature in historical
    materialism is based on the foundational work of John Bellamy Foster
    in *Marx’s Ecology* and Paul Burkett in *Marx and Nature*. See also
    Jason W. Moore’s understanding of capitalism-in-nature and
    nature-in-capitalism in his more recent *Capitalism in the Web of
    Life*. @foster_marx's_2000; @burkett_marx_2014; @moore_capitalism_2015. 

[^34]: In Ward’s years at the USGS, he worked under the guidance of
    Major John Wesley Powell, the second director of the U.S. Geological
    Survey and an early voice urging stewardship of the land in place of
    the purely extractive relationship that had until then prevailed.
    Powell’s work was in turn built on the foundation of George Perkins
    Marsh’s revolutionary work from 1864, often taken as an originary
    text for consciousness of the Anthropocene: *Man and Nature: Or,
    Physical Geography as Modified by Human Action*. On Ward in the
    context of Powell and Marsh, see @ross_man_1975. On Ward’s relationship
    with Powell and Powell’s place in the history of American
    conservation, see @worster_river_2000 442.

    410; on Ward and social engineering, see @mcnamara_ames_1992 217–35.

[^40]: See @egan_conservation_2011 77. On Gilman's relationship to eugenics
more broadly, see @davis_his_2003.

[^41]: This Marxian concept is authoritatively examined in @foster_marx's_2000.

[^42]: See especially @gilman_women_1966, @gilman_home_2002, and @gilman_waste_1913. For the wider
    context of domestic reform in Gilman’s work and in the context of
    the early twentieth century, see @gaudelieus_kitchenless_1999, @allen_building_1988, and @hayden_two_1978.

[^44]: @gilman_women_1966 242-3. See also @allen_building_1988: “By
    the middle of the nineteenth century, roughly one-third of American
    women entered the paid labor force on a temporary basis, usually
    until they married. Only the poorest women—immigrants, widows, and
    free blacks—engaged in a lifelong effort to make ends meet
    financially by working outside of their homes” (12). See also @chang_economics_2010,
    especially 323-4; and @fusco_systems_2009 420-1.

[^48]: The concept is outlined in a book of the same name: @daly_steady_1977.

[^52]: Ecosystem services can be defined simply as the benefits derived from an ecosystem, but can be subdivided into the types of specific services described here (and others). See @leemans_millennium_2003 53-8. Including humans as providers of ecosystem services might seem peculiarly tautological, since humans are the ones who are *deriving* the benefits, but that is precisely what is unique about Gilman's system, even today. She includes humans on both sides of the equation, as those who derive benefits but also as one of those in the ecosystem.

[^56]: This concept will be elaborated further in the “Ambient Labor”
    section below.

[^57]: For more on systems as a paradigm of production, personhood, and
    society in *Herland*, and more specifically the relevance of
    Frederick Winslow Taylor’s *The Principles of Scientific
    Management*: @fusco_systems_2009.

[^58]: The description of this system as permacultural is less anachronistic than it might seem,
    given that F. H. King's *Farmers of Forty Centuries*, a study of "Permanent Agriculture" in 
    China, Japan, and Korea, was published in 1900.[@king_farmers_1911] There is no evidence to suggest
    that Gilman read King's work, but the concepts were in circulation in America at the time.
    For evidence of another naturalist author interested in King's work and proto-permacultural
    farming methods, see @tichi_jack_2015.

[^61]: Cf. @daly_steady-state_1977.

[^63]: This aspect of the novel has been widely discussed in Gilman
    scholarship, as has the understanding of motherhood as an ecological
    and systemic process. @shishin_gender_1998; @fusco_systems_2009; and @hall_mothers_1989.

[^64]: I allude here to the title of Charles Walcutt's influential mid-century study of 
    naturalism: @walcutt_american_1956.
