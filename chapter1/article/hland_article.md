There is no “nature” apart from the human in Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland
(1915), a utopian novel in which three male explorers discover a land of
parthenogenetically reproducing women. They find a land “in a state of perfect
cultivation, where even the forests looked as if they were She cared for; a
land that looked like an enormous park, only that it was even more evidently an
enormous garden”; a land more “petted” than any before seen (“even in Germany,”
the birthplace of modern forestry), as a result of which nearly all of the
trees are “[f]ood-bearing.”[@gilman_herland_2012 42-4] This is not to say that the land is all cleared and
tilled, plastered over with monocultural production in the manner so familiar
to the twenty-first century. Rather, the humans of Herland guide these systems
as part of them, increasing through the same subtle methods their environment’s
vitality and its capacity to sustain human life. They are ubiquitous but
decentered, ghosts in the machine of a mechanistic nature. And yet, despite
this mechanism, which in the Baconian legacy makes nature something to be
dominated, Herland’s culture is marked by a profound respect for and
cooperation with the natural world, a recognition of the consequences of action
without attention to the material entanglements on which civilization relies.
The result of this respect is that, while there is no “nature” without the
human, there is also, conversely, no economics that is not also ecology. The
product of labor in Herland is not saleable produce but life-sustaining
environments, self-improving systems that include the human. As such, the
products, if they can be called that, are held in common, not only among humans
but across all life in the Herland ecosystem. In the absence of a money
economy, such guiding intervention constitutes the *raison d’être* of human
activity. Extending this activity to the scale of the society as a whole, we
might call it *ambient labor*: a conception of environments as objects of
economic production, produced by methods that are themselves understood as part
of the environment they produce. In such a system, economic activity at once
fades into the background and creates it.

This is the utopian wing of Anthropocene literature, born at least a
century ago, when the Anthropocene was not so much an object of thought
as an uneasy premonition, the conditions that would create it immature
but nascent and ominously powerful.[^4] *Herland*, traditionally read for 
its proto-feminist insights, is due not just the
ecocritical rereading it has recently begun to receive, but
recognition as part of the intellectual prehistory of one of our most
important contemporary concepts.[^5] Herland has an Anthropocene of its own,
one that begins (ironically) with
a geological event beyond the reach of human activity, namely, a
volcanic eruption that seals the only passage out of their  “high spur of rock” 
set above the surrounding
forest; the resulting isolation forces them to come to terms with their
own destructive and, eventually, productive potential as agents of
environmental change and ecological guidance. Yet Gilman’s response to
these evolving conditions confounds the way we talk about the
Anthropocene in the humanities now, because although she presents an
ecological imaginary in which there is no nature free from human
influence, she also depicts the natural world as more robust because of
this fact. Along with their recognition of the destructive capacity
latent in unmanaged human activity, Gilman and some of her
contemporaries in the sciences also saw the possibility for optimism in
an environmental future defined by human activity.

The twenty-first-century instantiation of this optimism is often
referred to as the “good Anthropocene,” a diverse collection of
perspectives that imagine an Anthropocene without catastrophe and suggest
that embracing human influence over the planetary ecology could
ultimately benefit all involved. One of the the most extreme versions of the good
Anthropocene, "An Ecomodernist Manifesto," celebrates the apparently boundless expanses of human
ingenuity, viewing limits to growth as temporary obstacles---a view that
many, especially in the environmental humanities, understandably see as
an uncomplicated justification of our domination over nature or as yet
another vehicle for capital investment.[^6] Another version of the good
Anthropocene more reasonably emphasizes the necessity to adapt and
mitigate, acknowledging the scale of human influence on the planet
without giving in to a dystopian vision of the future.[@bennett_bright_2016] Whatever
the version, though, the good Anthropocene is hardly new except in
name---though perhaps not in the sense its critics might assume, as an
uncomplicated return to the bad old days of exploitation. In fact, the
twenty-first century conception of a good Anthropocene reflects an earlier moment
in the history of ecological and evolutionary history, one that has faded
behind more hegemonic intellectual lineages, in which humanity was seen as neither fully
subject to Darwinian determinism nor an omnipotent force of waste and destruction, 
but nature's own consciousness. 

Reading it in the context of Lester F. Ward's
*Dynamic Sociology*, a work by which Gilman was influenced both sociologically
and for its environmental thinking, it becomes clear that *Herland* is a
literary representation of an environmental stewardship seen as a process of 
reforming humanity’s interactions with the natural world rather than 
lessening them. This article will examine *Herland*’s ecological vision as a theory of the
good Anthropocene *avant la lettre*, showing that Gilman saw reform of
humanity’s economic systems (into ambient labor) as a way to reconcile
humanity’s omnipresent and determinative influence on nature with the
desire for a more verdant world. Such a reading is an opportunity to 
extract an ecological-economic
conception of labor that is tailored to conditions that anticipate those
of the twenty-first century; it also can, and must, be taken
as a test-case for the Promethean optimism of the good Anthropocene,
grounds to explore the less salutary outcomes that are elided when the
impact of humanity on the natural world is embraced rather than
lessened.

If such a reading complicates the way the Anthropocene is commonly
mobilized in the humanities, it will also call for a reconsideration of
Gilman’s literary moment. Formally and narratively, *Herland* strains
the ideological and aesthetic purviews of its genre, American
literary naturalism, forcing us to reconsider some of the genre’s
defining characteristics as they have traditionally been constituted by
its critics. Jennifer Fleissner’s influential rereading of naturalism in
*Women, Compulsion, Modernity* (2004) lays the groundwork for rethinking
these definitions. She argues that where earlier readings of the genre
presume a “known-in-advance ‘nature’ lost or refound,” there is actually
“a far more nuanced and serious confrontation with the meanings of
‘nature’’s changing status in the modern world.”[@fleissner_women_2004 7] With Fleissner, I
suggest that the logic of “determinism” in naturalism, be it biological,
environmental, economic, or historical determinism, is more complicated
than it seems. Until the turn of the twenty-first century, determinism
dominated the naturalist critical conversation through the “plot of
decline” or the “plot of triumph” over always-pernicious external
“forces.” While "determinism" refers to a simplistic premise that
individual will is at the mercy of dominating "forces," more generous and nuanced
discussions of determinism in naturalism see it as complicating conceptions of
individual agency and the coherent self rather than reducing that self
to the point of irrelevance.[^9] Fleissner has moved the conversation beyond
even the more nuanced accounts of determinism, her focus on the genre’s
women leading her to replace the concept with a theory of “compulsion,”
or entrapment in a pattern of “ongoing, nonlinear, repetitive
motion.”[@fleissner_women_2004 9] Sharing Fleissner’s complicating impulse without wanting
to do away with determinism entirely, I see in Gilman and other
naturalist writers a system of *mutual determinism*, a coevolutionary
counterpoint to Darwinian environmental determinism. Under conditions of
mutual determinism, the human remains “determined” by environmental
forces but is also able to transform those determining forces through
collective action<!--I have to make sure this is still represented in the
final section; it may have fallen out-->. In Gilman’s resultant utopian form of
naturalism,[^11] collectivist environmental praxis becomes humanity’s
means of transforming itself by transforming its environment.

The context of the Anthropocene, then, makes this mutual determinism
more visible in works of literary naturalism, but the context of
literary naturalism also reveals the ways in which the Anthropocene as a
heuristic challenges the deterministic logic of many of our stories
about nature. On one hand, reading *Herland* as part of the intellectual
pre-history of the Anthropocene, and more particularly of the good
Anthropocene, brings into focus the ways in which the human has long
been conceived as a simultaneously determining and determined force. On
the other hand, it also reveals the capacity of the Anthropocene to
challenge a pervasive myth of the human as an innocent non-agent on
which natural forces act---an inverse of the familiar Baconian story of
nature as inert, but perhaps no less pernicious. The Anthropocene, in
other words, challenges the unidirectionality of deterministic
ontologies, replacing the post-Darwinian conception of “organism plus
environment” with a more ecological understanding of complex networks of
influence and interaction.[@haraway_staying_2016 30] Reading the Anthropocene and literary
naturalism together is less a matter of updating literary naturalism
than it is of realizing that the “nature” of naturalism is a highly
contested ground in the body of literature itself, that the version of
“nature” on which theories of naturalism have commonly been premised
represents but one entry in a wider set, and that these conflicting
perspectives, taken as a whole, prefigure many of the debates we are
having today about how to understand the place of the human in nature.
As Donna Haraway puts it, riffing on British social anthropologist
Marilyn Strathern, “it matters what stories we tell other stories
with,...what thoughts think thoughts.”[@haraway_staying_2016 12] The premise of my approach
here is that, through *Herland*’s mutual determinism and ambient labor,
literary naturalism and the Anthropocene can think each other.

What follows will be divided into three sections. The first will show
how Gilman backgrounds the human in her narrative, a process that
challenges the traditional role of naturalist description established by
Lukács at the same time that it reforms inhabitation into a
coevolutionary act. The next section will extend the concept of
backgrounding to Herland’s economy, exploring the system of ambient
labor that results from folding economic activity into ecological
processes. The conclusion will argue that what is true of *Herland* is
not an exception in the wider purview of its genre, but indicates a
broader correspondence between literary naturalism and the Anthropocene.

### Backgrounding the Human: The Garden, the Full World, and Coevolutionary Inhabitation

For much of her life, Gilman kept a garden---a “vegetable garden mind
you!, not merely flowers”---at one point as a partial means of
subsistence, at another as what she referred to as a “sanitarium.”[@gilman_selected_2009 180, 281, 284]
Herland is insistently presented as a garden in itself, but a peculiar
one, in which the gardener is both the manager of the garden and, as it
were, one of the plants. Yet this “garden” is also the world entire as
it is known to Herland, subject to conditions (of population and
resource availability) that would amount to extreme scarcity were it not
for the Herlanders’ careful attention to their place in the overlapping
systems of their environment. To understand Herland ecologically thus
requires a mediation between two opposed paradigms for conceiving of
natural environments: the garden and the full world. The garden paradigm
is a fundamentally utopian and Edenic environmental imaginary in which
the human is master and beneficiary but does not lessen the vitality of
the natural system as a whole.[^15] The full world paradigm is a
dystopian and Malthusian one in which ultimate limits are finally
encountered and survival requires transformative systemic change through
collective human action. They are opposed reactions to a common set of
conditions: the world’s containment, its apprehension as a holistic
system due to its containment, and the supposition that the human has a
defining role in this system’s character. The dialectical tension
between these two paradigms is the same that is encountered by
contemporary theories of the good Anthropocene, which paradoxically
acknowledge the dystopian potential of unmanaged human activity while
responding with a utopian vision of collective environmental management.

To depict this intersection, Gilman backgrounds human activity both in
the setting and the country’s history. By *backgrounding* I refer to a
double operation of deemphasizing human activity, making the people and
their products appear as part of the natural environment, and using the
descriptive rendering of the environment as a vehicle for the novel’s
arguments. Through this process, Gilman’s novel formally reflects the
new form of human inhabitation it theorizes, and in so doing complicates
the traditional reading of description in the naturalist genre. But the
term “backgrounding” is also chosen to reflect the status of women’s labor. Where contemporary ecofeminists name and resist instances where
the contributions of environments and women are placed in the
background,[^16] especially the acts of motherhood and reproduction that
unite historical conceptions of both, Gilman backgrounds everything,
placing all work on the level of domestic, reproductive, and ecological
processes. Finally, backgrounding as a term reflects the potential for
concealment, for the utopia of Herland’s gardenic present is built on
the dystopia of its full-world past. Like the modernity celebrated in
the Ecomodernist manifesto, Gilman’s utopianism has strategic elision of
historical traumas and inequalities as a precondition.

Gilman’s narrative backgrounding begins with her environmental
descriptions, in which she establishes the omnipresence of human
activity while also figuring her own social and economic arguments in
the landforms themselves. She provides a conspicuously cartographical
overview, delivered as the three male protagonists view Herland from a
biplane, hoping to get “the lay of the land” before they descend.[@gilman_herland_2012 41]
This vantage point allows them to see in one glance the argument in the
terrain, though they do not recognize it as such. Gilman’s own world
construction---primarily through description---is carefully controlled to
create the kind of “nature” she is most interested in discussing,
anticipating the way Herlanders themselves will manipulate their
physical environment to achieve an ecological ideal.

Distinct types of natural space occur where they will be most useful to
the human inhabitants of Herland, a schema whose organization betrays
intentional influence and while its agentless narrative framing suggests
natural development. Describing Herland from the boundaries in, Vandyck
says, “It appeared to be well forested about the edges, but in the
interior there were wide plains, and everywhere parklike meadows and
open places”; while forest is clustered on the edges of Herland, only
“closely cultivated gardens” mark the interior plains.[@gilman_herland_2012 42, 47] The
organization of natural spaces reflects Herland’s distribution of urban
spaces, as it clears the way for transportation between an interior
network of small cities throughout the interior.[^19] They are connected
by “clean, well-built roads” that permit the speed with which three
Herlanders on foot are able to distance themselves from the male
intruders and the speed of their electric ground vehicles---"an easy rate of some thirty miles an hour."[@gilman_herland_2012 42, 47, 71] The relegation of the forest to the edges of
Herland, then, and the creation of various types of landscape that exist
throughout, creates a setting that appears natural but is catered to
human use.

Be that as it may, these are not dead spaces, nor purely functional
ones. Though they are crossed by sterile “perfect roads, as dustless as
a swept floor,” the plains are also idealized as natural spaces.
Alongside these roads are “the shade of endless lines of trees” and “the
ribbon of flowers that unrolled beneath them, and the rich comfortable
country that stretched off and away, full of varied charm.”[@gilman_herland_2012 71]
“Varied” works as both an aesthetic category here (with “charm”) and an
incidental marker of biodiversity, its double semantic function
mirroring what a permaculturalist might refer to as the “stacking
functions” of these trees and gardens, serving both human purposes and
the broader ecology.[@hemenway_gaias_2009 33-4] Here as throughout the novel, Gilman presents
a land that is constructed for a purpose; but more accurately, it is
constructed for multiple purposes cutting across the human and
extra-human communities, its human uses coextensive with natural
fecundity rather than in tension with it. 

The human is reflected in natural landscapes through the ideologies that
have been used to shape them; human Herlanders are also integrated into
the landscape more directly, becoming backgrounded through Gilman’s
insistent representation of them as flora and fauna. Animal and insect
metaphors abound as they run and leap “like deer...not as if it was a
performance, but as if it was their natural gait”; though not “as alike
as so many ants or aphids,” they are repeatedly compared to the
hymenoptera order that includes bees and ants, as when their
commonplaces are compared to “the way the ants and bees would talk---do
talk, maybe” and their nurseries to an “ant-hill.”[@gilman_herland_2012 61, 93, 97, 102] The metaphors
range freely into the plant kingdom, as well, particularly in the case
of child rearing. The children grow up "as naturally as young trees”
because they are given an environment that promotes this growth, using
methods “they had found in their work with plants”; the result is a
community that is compared to “the most perfectly cultivated richly
developed roses” despite the fact that they do not “seem ‘cultivated’ at
all---it had all become a natural condition.”[@gilman_herland_2012 98, 102, 118] This backgrounding
ultimately leads to invisibility (or concealment) for the humans of
Herland. After a fruitless escape attempt early in the novel, the men
are returned to their comfortable captivity and realize they had been
surrounded the entire time, “had been seen, by careful ladies sitting
snugly in big trees by the riverbed, or up among the rocks.”[@gilman_herland_2012 72] Human
individuals become part of the environment just as easily as their
ideologies do. Indeed, becoming part of the environment in the
background *is* the ideology.

Backgrounding constitutes a unique form of description, or at least a
unique literary use to which description can be put. Georg Lukács’s
foundational essay “Narrate or Describe,” for example, singularly fails
to capture the integration of event and background as it appears in
*Herland*. Lukács privileges works in which events are "*narrated* from the
standpoint of the participant" over those in which they are "*described* 
from the standpoint of the observer" because the former integrates description
into the "total action of the novel" while the latter constitutes 
"mere filler." Human "action" is forgrounded against a background of 
inert natural and built environments. Of course, for Lukács, the point
of this distinction is the relative ability to capture the contradictions
of capitalism. Description fails because it presents "social facts...as *caput
mortuum* of a social process" where narration captures the process itself.[@kahn_narrate_2005 111-115] 
By this logic, the majority of Gilman’s
intensely descriptive novel would surely be considered a crypt of
*capita mortua*.

Yet it is telling that there is no place for nature in Lukác’s binary, a
hierarchy in which valuable action is always human and worthless
description is always of the products of human activity (dead labor) or
of non-human environments as *mise-en-scene* (in the case of the
agricultural fair, dead animals). If description fails to capture
the processes by which capitalist contradictions come to be, an
anthropocentric narration can never capture the processes by which
*environments* come to be.[^30] It is
not that Gilman privileges description over narration, but that in
putting people in the background as one part (albeit a decisive one) of
the processes by which environments come to be, narration and
description lose the absolute distinction that Lukács assigns them.

Indeed, the plot of *Herland*, its chain of events, is inseparable from
the management of natural systems that defines the content of its
descriptions. But these events are subordinated to the needs of the
setting rather than the other way around. Any human-centric chain of
events essentially concludes when the men’s attempted escape from
Herland is thwarted, giving way instead to a system-focused
narrative in which three new elements, the three men, are considered for
introduction into the overlapping human and non-human processes. Only when
they are “tamed and trained to a degree [the Herlanders] considered
safe” are the men “at last brought out to see the country, to know the
people.”[@gilman_herland_2012 98] The three men represent three different outcomes: Jeff is
fully integrated, marrying into the Herland society and accepting their
values wholesale; Terry is fully rejected, having resisted integration
entirely from start to finish; and Vandyck is essentially accepted but
decides to leave and take with him, or even replicate, the system of
values into which he has been accepted. If
the women of Herland are already backgrounded in the descriptions that
define the novel’s setting, the human plot is one of the process of
backgrounding.

Backgrounding thus results in the dissolution of an anthropocentric,
event-driven narrative in favor of one in which the human “protagonists”
become the dual subjects and objects of a human-ecological system. And
to the extent that they become part of this system, the background
itself becomes the true protagonist.

<!-- pick up here -->

Putting humans in the background, combining event and description, and
decentering the human from the protagonist role are narrative
reflections of a coevolutionary form of inhabitation. Coevolutionary
inhabitation means, simply, that the changes in the human realm are
mutually determinative with changes to the environment, a human-nonhuman
feedback loop. The resulting relationship between human Herlanders and
their environment is defined not by the Hobbesian war of all against
all, so essential to Darwinian evolution and its misapplications to
social life, but by guided transformation in which competition is
deemphasized in favor of mutual sustenance. Linking the fates of the
human and the environment in this way leads to an ecological reformism
similar to that of the domestic reform movements that were a prominent
feature of Gilman’s early writings.

In some of the essays preceding *Herland*, Gilman espoused a vision of
the human-nature relationship in which environmental transformation was
part of a larger process of human evolution. That is to say, the natural
world is arrogated to the human by default, in this view, but so is
responsibility for its stewardship. She saw the human species and its
environment both as mutable, and indeed, as in need of conscious
mutation to avoid unconscionable waste and suffering. In a 1908 article
“Modern Beatitudes---The Newness of the Earth,” for example, she suggests
that Earth and humanity are both mere children, as yet relatively
undeveloped but always growing into greater harmony. The evolution of
the human race is framed as an ever-increasing understanding of the
planetary effects of our activity coupled with adaptation based on that
understanding. After describing the exhaustion of Earth’s resources by
“our present methods,” Gilman reassures us that the process will not
continue to its catastrophic conclusion, for we

> are waking up in good earnest these days; ceasing to be a baby race, a
> set of ignorant, selfish, short-sighted infants, madly quarreling with
> one another over the fruits most easily gathered. We are young yet,
> but no longer mere children; young with the splendid hope and courage
> of youth, but not with the weakness and irresponsibility of infancy.…
> All we have to do is to apply ourselves to study the conditions of
> life on earth, and learn to meet them.[@gilman_modern_1908]

As Gilman tells it, humanity will be saved by its inevitable development
into a wiser, gentler race. Progress is not the social Darwinist Herbert
Spencer’s steady march from simplicity to complexity or continued
expansion to the edges of the Earth, ignoring all limits.[^33] It is instead a renunciation of
wastefulness and destructive behavior, which is to be replaced by the
more careful management of the natural environment. With anticipatory
echoes of both *Herland* and the Ecomodernists’ belief in the
transformative capacity of human society, she suggests that there “is
absolutely nothing prevent us from reforesting our hills, checking our
floods, preserving our soils, maintaining the balance of nature plus the
art and skill and learning of mankind.” By framing this development in
terms of the growth of the human species---and indeed, of the planetary
system as a whole---she builds her vision of coevolution on a simultaneous
development of human and environment, not by on opposition to be
resolved through conflict. Joining with the environment replaces
dominating it as the means by which humanity will thrive in “Modern
Beatitudes,” just as entering the background becomes the key to survival
in *Herland*.

This account of teleological human evolution was largely an artifact of
her extrapolations from the theories of Lester F. Ward. Ward was a
friend and inspiration to Gilman who would go on to become an important
founding figure in sociology, but only after serving as the chief
paleobotanist for the U.S. Geological Survey in an environment rife with
conservationist ideas and ideals---ideals that led him to differ from
Herbert Spencer, the figure more commonly seen as the naturalists’
gateway to evolutionary theory.[^34] Ward understood humanity’s
potential for destructive transformation of the planet and was
unequivocal in pointing out the destructive trend of humanity’s
interactions with the natural world, pointing out the rapidity with
which resources from forests to soil to animals are exhausted to satisfy
“temporary wants” of the “first occupants, who know only the immediate
present.”[@ward_dynamic_1926 2:88-9] This is not grounds for lessening humanity’s impact on
its environment, however---precisely the opposite. From Ward’s
perspective, this wastefulness and “wanton disregard of the future” are
the traits that make the human most *natural*. What he sees in humanity,
he sees to an even greater degree in nature. The “wasteful methods
[that] prevail in society” derive from those “in the animal and
vegetable kingdoms,” and nature itself “acts on the assumption that her
resources are inexhaustible.”[@ward_dynamic_1926 2:87-8] The only hope is for the human
species to fulfil its rightful role as the source of teleology in the
natural world, replacing the randomness and suffering of Darwinian
nature and genetic mutation. And yet, for all this talk of the human
responsibility to take over where nature has fallen short, the human
remains *part* of “this great unconscious creative whole called nature”
nature: the solution is not to get out of nature but to fix it.[@ward_dynamic_1926 2:11] It
is as though nature developed humanity as its brain, and humanity has
since, rightly, taken command of what Marx would call “man’s inorganic
body,” the rest of the natural world.[@marx_early_2005 328]

In a Wardian sense, then, guided coevolution means on one hand accepting
the teleological transformations that humanity effects on its
environments as a matter of course, and on the other hand accepting the
shortcomings of these transformations when they are performed by what
Gilman calls a “baby race” that too closely mirrors the wastefulness of
nature. The first step in a truly salutary guidance of coevolution must
be the social transformation of humanity into a collective that is able
to responsibly transform the natural world, a transformation that will
in turn continually transform them (being part of nature themselves).

And yet, as will not be surprising to contemporary critics of Ward’s
social theories,[^39] even what is a seemingly more relational social
application of evolutionary theory presents major challenges to both
human and environmental ethics, challenges that any form of teleological
progress towards a good Anthropocene must address. Guiding a natural
system that includes humanity as a biological body is, of course, part
of a broader sympathy for eugenics for which Gilman and Ward have often
and rightly been criticized. Kristen R. Egan argues that Gilman
“associates a clean environment with a clean race,” and that the need to
“sanitize” the natural environment through management is closely tied to
a contemporaneous desire to preserve the nation for, and through the
creation of, a racially homogenous body of future Americans.[^40] The
guided evolution of Gilman’s Herlanders is pursued in part through
collective control over who reproduces and to what extent. Here is one
place where “backgrounding” takes on a sinister cast, for the
decision-making process determining reproductive rights receives much
less attention than the perceived benefits. Nor does couching this
process in the management of other species, ethically dubious in its own
right, redeem it. One need only remember that Francis Galton’s original
case for eugenics is built from a foundation of different sects of
humanity (racial or otherwise) with different species in a zoo to see
how easily the management of non-human species can bleed dangerously
into the management of human Others. Finally, the men discover that
women, the rational managers of this ecological and social system, were
only able to come to power---only able to experience the birth of their
all-female race---after quelling a slave uprising that killed the free men
of the pre-Herland nation, the free women killing in turn all the
formerly enslaved men (though they do appear to have welcomed the
formerly enslaved women who remained to at least some extent).
Backgrounding human actions in submerged historical narratives and the
seemingly agentless transformation of physical space let Herlanders off
the hook for, as Benjamin might have it, the barbarism that undergirds
their civilization.

And yet, though Gilman’s support of eugenic intervention is
irredeemable, it is also not the whole or even the primary story in
*Herland*’s conception of guided change in the social ecology. The
process by which their social ecology is transformed has much more to do
with the alteration of physical and social structures to repair what
Marx called the “metabolic rift” in the energetic and material
circulation between town and country.[^41] Reform of the physical
environment preoccupied Gilman’s work well before *Herland*, cutting
through her domestic reform activism as well as her theoretical writing,
but these earlier explorations of the topic focused less on the natural
environment than the built environment. Throughout her career, she
sharply criticized the relegation of women to the domestic sphere and
the exploitation inherent in domestic labor;[^42] among the most
programmatic of the results was her campaign for the kitchenless
household, that is, a change in physical structures that she hoped would
change something fundamental to human society. In *Women and Economics*,
she argues that “change in the economic position of woman from
dependence to independence must bring with it a rearrangement of these
home interests and industries.”[@gilman_women_1966 224] Thus, she lays out a vision of
“apartments…without kitchens” except those “belonging to the house from
which meals could be served to the families in their rooms or in a
common dining-room” in larger domiciles, hoping thereby to liberate the
“hundreds of thousands of women in New York City alone who are
wage-earners, and who also have families.”[^44] Objecting to the
cultural backgrounding of women’s domestic labor, she brings the sites
of their labor into the foreground---the precise opposite of what she
would do in *Herland*. But in both cases, economic and social change
begins with alteration of the physical environment.

Though the relationship of foreground to background is reversed, in
*Herland* Gilman’s meditations on kitchenless households combine with
her Wardian evolutionary theory to form a system in which the constant
transformations that define human inhabitation of space consciously feed
into a self- and environment-forming feedback loop. Domestic reform
easily becomes environmental reform because the country itself becomes
one big home. As Jeff, the eventual male Herlander, puts it in response
to Terry’s complaints that “There isn’t a home in the whole pitiful
place”: “There isn’t anything else [than home], and you know it.”
Descriptions of the physical infrastructure contain many passages that
could be taken right from a kitchenless household pamphlet, as when Van
explains that for “food we either went to any convenient eating-house,
ordered a meal brought in, or took it with us to the woods, always and
equally good.”[@gilman_herland_2012 144] In this context, unlike in the more purely social
texts like *Women and Economics*, the ramifications of such a change are
not limited to a bounded realm of humanity. By bringing consumption into
the larger, self-sustaining system of Herland as a whole and making
cooking and eating a public activity, these communal eating-houses also
reduce material waste and make it possible to manage entirely the waste
that *is* produced. Centralization makes it possible to incorporate food
production into their “perfect scheme of refeeding the soil with all
that came out of it”: “All the scraps and leavings of their food, plant
waste from lumber work or textile industry, all the solid matter from
the sewage, properly treated and combined---everything which came from the
earth went back to it.”[@gilman_herland_2012 104] Herland’s communal kitchens would thus
fertilize the soil while eliminating the need for private domestic
labor, as such labor is incorporated into the ecology and the economy at
once.

It is a shift that has defining ecological benefits, as the industrial
economy of “Ourland” (what Gilman would call the world beyond Herland in the novel's
the sequel) is replaced by an encompassing domestic one in Herland,
focused on sustenance of human and environment alike as well as their
increasing codependence. It is difficult to separate taking care of
oneself from taking care of one’s environment when the natural
environment is less a reservoir of exploitable resources than an
environment for living, something that reflects and even defines the
self while at the same time demanding management. Considering
world-as-home in the context of Gilman’s broader environmental insights,
it becomes clear that this reevaluation of the home and inhabitation is
also part of achieving a greater ecological maturity, aligning human
activity with the health of an ecosystem. The backgrounding that so
defines *Herland*’s narrative form is merely a device for embedding this
alignment within the substance of the novel itself.

Coevolutionary inhabitation represents a concomitance of Gilman’s
evolutionary theory with her theories of domestic reform; it is also a
basis for a social ecology of the type demanded by any version of the
good Anthropocene. The mutually sustaining social-ecological feedback
loop that defines her system resolves in miniature the problems of the
too-human natural environment by putting a “better” human in the
background, as a determinative element of the larger system.

### Ambient Labor as an Early Ecological Economics

Nowhere are the effects of backgrounding more transformative than the
Herland economy, which becomes singularly difficult to describe in the
usual terms of standard economics. Not only, as Alex Shishin points out, are we "left 
to deduce what Herland's industry and political economy are like by 
piecing together clues scattered throughout the novel" due to Gilman's 
unusual economic reticence, but the resulting economy is marked by
"contradictions and ambiguities"---due in no small part to the peculiarity 
of what is depicted.[@shishin_gender_1998 100] A different set of economic
categories is needed to represent an economy that exists within the
constraints of the ecology and conceives of nature as more than a bank
of raw materials.

More pointedly, the terms of ecological economics are needed here, even
though introducing them is anachronistic, and even though they will
also, ultimately, fall slightly short. Ecological economics radically
recenters the materiality of economic value, conceiving of the economy
as a system constrained by the energetic and material flows that make up
ecosystems. In other words, it insistently focuses on what standard
economics conveniently forgets, that the environment is both the source
of all value and the ultimate limit to growth. Representing the
departure of ecological economics from standard economics, Joan
Martinez-Alier says that ecological economics “sees the economy not as a
circuit or spiral of exchange value, a merry-go-round of producers and
consumers, but instead as an entropic flow of energy and materials that
runs through the economy.”[@guha_varieties_1997] Further, where standard economics
discusses production, ecological economics focuses on *re*production,
seeking to limit resource depletion and pollution within the constraints
that will allow the ecosystem to continually reproduce itself and
develop. Herman Daly, in one of the founding texts of the field,
describes the resulting system as a “steady-state economy.”[^48] Though
a recent and relatively minor economic sub-field, ecological economics
will be essential to any economically focused vision of a good
Anthropocene.

These descriptions of ecological economics might just as well describe
*Herland* from an ecological perspective. And yet, texts included in
surveys of ecological economics do not usually predate the 1970s. It
took the twentieth century’s Great Acceleration to bring into focus the
necessity of an economics that could act as “a response to the pressing
environmental problems of the twentieth century” and explain, as
standard economics could not, “the unprecedented decline in
biodiversity, the changing climate, [and] increased generation of waste,
all caused by the pursuit of economic growth.”[@shmelev_ecological_2012 3-8] Like the
Anthropocene itself, however, ecological economics has a prehistory that
extends at least into the nineteenth century. John Bellamy Foster points
out that the roots of ecological economics can be found in strains of
early Marxian economics in which soil science and the study of
energetics, such as Sergei Podoloski in 1880 and, even earlier, Marx’s
own interest in the work of Justus von Liebig.[@foster_marxs_2000 166-7] There is no evidence
that Gilman was familiar with this work, but *Herland* should
nevertheless be considered as an early literary precursor of ecological
economics for its own material economic insights, which respond to the
conditions that are now known as the Anthropocene and more generally
result from the problems of a full world.

Gilman’s depiction of labor is the most interesting aspect of *Herland*
from the perspective of ecological economics, for the system of
backgrounded, environment-forming activity constitutes what I am calling
“ambient labor.” Herland’s ambient labor is distinct from labor under
extractive capitalism primarily in that it conceives of its product as
the *environment itself* and the systems that make it up, not
commodities. At the same time, this ambient labor is also understood as
a *part* of the environment it helps produce, fading into the background
of both life and narration just as the Herlanders themselves do. It
differs from other forms of labor in that it is a total system,
voluntary, and divorced from the production of commodities and exchange.
But, crucially, it anticipates some aspects of ecological economics by
including "ecosystem services" in the economic balance sheet, such
as absorbing carbon and producing oxygen in the case of plants or
cycling nutrients and transporting seeds in the case of animals; but
it is peculiar even among ecological economic theories in that it
includes the biological functions of humans as ecological services on
par with those provided by plants and animals.[^52] Human *actions*
contribute to ambient labor in the extent to which they form and are
part of the environment, but the human’s *being* is also a crucial part
of the system. Indeed, labor and being become almost inseparable.

Ambient labor is not theorized directly, but can be inferred from what
is shown of the economy and the roles within it. In the example of
Ellador, a Herland forester, we see a characteristic mode of Herland
labor as well as a sense of how human welfare and ecosystem welfare
coexist---but this coexistence does not necessarily take the expected
form:

> “It was a butterfly that made me a forester,” said Ellador. “I was
> about eleven years old, and I found a big purple and green butterfly
> on a low flower. I caught it, very carefully, by the closed wings, as
> I had been told to do, and carried it to the nearest insect
> teacher...to ask her its name. She took it from me with a little cry
> of delight. ‘Oh, you blessed child…. This is a female of the obernut
> moth,’ she told me, ‘they are almost gone. We have been trying to
> exterminate them for centuries. If you had not caught this one, it
> might have laid eggs enough to raise worms enough to destroy thousands
> of our nut trees---thousands of bushels of nuts,---and make years and
> years of trouble for us.’…I grew a foot, it seemed to me, and
> determined then and there to be a forester.”[@gilman_herland_2012 123]

On the narrative level, this passage sets up, and then reverses, an
expectation of conservation, disclosing instead an ideology of
environmental management. The tender,
careful handling of the fragile creature will ultimately culminate, we
realize, in the its death, as well as the last stage in a deliberate
extinction of the entire species. Though not all of the methods of
influencing the system are premised on extermination, this episode
typifies the influence Herlanders seek to exert on their environment in
its focus on minimal interventions that will have outsized effects on
the system over time. The more characteristic method is one of gentle
guidance: the word “cultivated” is repeated many times with reference to
every aspect of the landscape, flora and fauna alike, as well as the
tiny gardens that dot the open plains---at one point the forests are
simply referred to as “the cultivated area”.[@gilman_herland_2012 66] The forests are not
planted or culled but “petted,” or indulged in their natural growth and
proliferation; similarly, the vines are “trained,” a term of
domestication but not inherently of exploitation. The forced extinction
of the obernut moth is treated with the same way, an air of tenderness
coloring what is ultimately a quietly horrific act. This recasting
effectively invokes an uncomplicated reverence for the “natural world”
only to replace it with a commitment to finding the “natural” system
that most benefits humans (and also the fictional obernut tree, if only
incidentally). Understanding that the obernut moth limits the
propagation of the obernut, and realizing that the obernut is Herland’s
“best food-nut,” they create a situation in which nurturing the
environment they have crafted will mean nurturing themselves (123).[@gilman_herland_2012 123]

Even the social norms and structures in Herland result from the
ecological roles played by the Herlanders, individually and
collectively. Ellador is narrating her formation of a professional
identity---the moment when she conceives of herself in terms of her role
in the economy and is celebrated for it. But the nature of the “work” in
Herland is such that this moment is inseparable from the realization of
her place in the *ecology*, as a conscious limiting factor of the
obernut moth in this case, and probably of other species in the future.
Ellador becomes more of a directed ecological force than a laborer. She
is not quite an agricultural producer, and yet her actions contribute to
the sufficient supply of food. She is not exactly employed by the state,
as a forester in our world might be, and yet her function to the
community is clear. Her duties are framed in terms of maintaining the
environment, and yet in doing so she is also maintaining herself---both
materially, by providing food for herself and others, and
psychologically, by embracing a coherent identity. In this ambiguous
form of labor, the social, economic, and ecological place of the
individual come together in ways that make them difficult to
distinguish.[^56]

Though its methods are ethically suspect and it is described in part by
its effects on the individual human, ambient labor’s transformative
capabilities are ultimately put in service of a stable and thriving, but
emphatically not “wild,” natural environment. The end goal of their
labor is always a more secure and comfortable means of survival that can
arise without coercion from their immediate ecosystem, as opposed to
profit-motivated industrial agriculture, which takes commodified produce
as its only object. Instead of understanding production on the level of
the product, they produce process; where the rapidly industrializing
society of 1915 America was defined by systems of production, Gilman’s
alternative opts for the production of systems.[^57]

In addition to being produced by backgrounded processes, the
environmental systems of Herland support ambient labor in that, by their
very nature, they constantly lessen the need for human intervention.
Horticulturally, this means that the Herland system resembles what we
would now call permaculture, an autonomous and self-maintaining
ecosystem that is nevertheless designed. For example, the extent of
forested land and the fact that all the trees are food-bearing suggest
that Herlanders cultivate food-bearing plants in quantities that go well
beyond what will be harvested, which would leave plenty of material for
the support of the non-human members of the ecosystem and the natural
propagation of the plants in question. In a permacultural system, the
soil is not improved by external inputs, but by the system’s own ability
to absorb its waste products; permacultural environments become
self-replicating and self-improving in the same way that a forest
is.[^58] Gilman specifies that “[I]nstead of the progressive
impoverishment so often seen in the rest of the world,” an
impoverishment that results in more and more maintenance and inputs as
the environment becomes less able to support itself, in Herland “an
increasingly valuable soil [is] built,” supporting autonomously
increasing vitality.[@gilman_herland_2012 105] The development of the Herland environment is
allowed to proceed without direct human maintenance, but the conditions
are set such that this autonomous development adheres to a desirable
course. Human Herlanders are not absent, of course, but only construct
the system at the beginning---as in “the deliberate replanting of an
entire forest area with different kinds of trees”---and then participate
in it as members, contributing to its self-improving nature.[@gilman_herland_2012 104]
Physical human labor in the active sense of standard economics would
thus constantly become more and more ambient, taken over by the working
of the system itself. Where human intervention does continue, it is
almost incidental---as is the case for Ellador, the forester discussed in
the introduction. And in the case of the production of soil, the main
place of intervention would be in byproducts of consumption---compostable
scraps and human excrement. As we have seen in the case of kitchenless
houses, composting and waste management are defined by systemic
interventions that either make use of or strategically prevent the
natural activity of the ecosystem’s organisms.

The economic value of these environmental systems, then, must be
measured by the degree to which human intervention is diminished by the
system itself. In the first place, in standard economics, anything
outside of a trade-based equation of raw materials and saleable
commodities is disregarded.[^61] For example, worker health, ecological
impacts, or downstream effects of the thing produced (such as its
disposal or impact on its consumers) only come under economic
consideration when they can be expressed as a change in the cost of
labor or fines levied for pollution. In Herland’s ambient labor, the
“equation” is composed entirely of the environmental health factors and
downstream effects that are forcibly excluded from the consideration of
standard economics. Betterment of the Herland environment cannot be
measured as “improvement” in terms of economic output, but must be
quantified in the scale of its ecological effects.

The difference can be understood, in the terms of ecological economics,
as a shift in focus from production to reproduction. This reproductive
focus is unusually literalized in *Herland* with its insistent focus on
child-rearing and education, not to mention the cult of motherhood that
is its religion. Specialization, for example, is framed as part of
creating an environment conducive to literal human reproduction: “They
developed all this close inter-service in the interests of their
children. To do the best work they had to specialize of course; the
children needed spinners and weavers, farmers and gardeners, carpenters
and masons, as well as mothers.”[@gilman_herland_2012 93] While some of these roles appear
to be devoted to the creation of products, they are prevented from
acting as commodities because there is no market in which to exchange
them, because they are held in common, and because they are conceived of
as part of a socialized reproduction. In other words, the products are
understood environmentally, just as the food of the communal
eating-houses is an extension of the freely accessed edibles of the
fields and gardens. Understanding the environment in this way extends
the regard Herlanders hold for their own children to the future
generations of the ecosystem’s other organisms by conceiving of a system
supports the environment’s replication of itself and the replication of
humans that comes with it, as opposed to the endless expansion of
humanity at the expense of everything else.

Finally, the Herlanders’ bodies themselves become one more ambient
system of reproduction. Including bodies in the economic system is a
natural effect of rendering the human as part of an ecology, but it also
means that human reproductive labor must be considered as an ecological
service. As she does more directly elsewhere in nonfiction writings like
*Women and Economics* (1898), in *Herland* Gilman defines motherhood as
an economically valuable contribution to the collective, which would be
either impossible or ethically complicated in a commodity-based economy
(for offspring would necessarily be commodified).[^63] When a division
of economic labor is expanded to include ecology, taking into account
the ecological services of human and nonhuman alike, incorporating human
reproduction into the economic division of labor simply subsumes it into
the managed regional ecology. In this context, their parthenogenetic
reproductive capacity is explicable less as a product of miraculous
genetic mutation than as a bodily extension of ambient labor, a
speculative conceit to put human biological processes on the same level
as those of domesticated plants and animals. Reproduction in the desired
proportions takes on the same inevitability and automatism of
production, becoming a feature of carefully (and communally) controlled
conditions rather than a sum of uncoordinated individual choice---with the
same worrying ethical implications of any attempt to control human
reproduction.

Ambient labor, then, is a cornerstone of Herland’s economic system and
an attempt to conceive of a reproductive economy that could replace a
productive one. In the terms of ecological economics, ambient labor is a
way to pursue a steady-state system in which progress is decoupled from
growth. As an anachronistic *contribution* to ecological economics, the
Herland economy is significant in that it identifies the intervention in
or reconstruction of environmental systems as a way to think about
economic activity that embraces a certain degree of determinative human
influence on our environments without giving in to the historically
prevalent destructiveness this influence. Crucially, the basis of this
embrace is understanding and acceding to a degree of mutual
determination, a process in which changing the environment means
changing the human and vice versa. It is far from clear whether it would
be possible, in the twenty-first century or beyond, to take the
environment as an object of labor and biological processes as the
teleological endpoint of constantly shifting means of production, but
from Gilman’s perspective in 1915 it seemed both possible and necessary
to imagine. In a moment when theorizing a good Anthropocene is one of
the only extant ways to imagine a salutary environmental future, such
theories are again---or are still---needed.

### Naturalism in the Anthropocene

This reading of *Herland*---as backgrounding human activity to cope with
humanity’s pervasive influence, a process that in turn leads to
revolutionary forms of inhabitation, ecological-economic exchange, and
labor---makes the novel in many ways a peculiar specimen of American
literary naturalism. In any case, it makes it peculiar in the context of
most naturalist criticism up to the previous fifteen years. Here, there
is no social Darwinism, nor a deterministic “plot of decline” in which a
heroic male character degrades under the influence of alcohol or
gambling. Nor do we find the paradigmatic capitalist struggles with the
markets, neither through domineering arch-speculators (as in *The
Financier*, *The Pit*, or *Burning Daylight*) nor through consumers
caught in the currents of window displays (*Sister Carrie*, *The House
of Mirth*). These paradigms are such poor fits for *Herland* that we
would be closer to the mark understanding it as a deliberate subversion
of these generic streams.[^64] In fact, it is in precisely this sense
that Gilman’s novel remains naturalist: it adopts naturalist logics to
subvert or reform them. *Herland* is determinist, but of a different
kind; it is invested in the role of human evolutionary history in
understanding the individual, but its investment is not strictly
Darwinian; it narrates complex economic structures, but does not contain
itself to the capitalist system.

This subversion is most obvious and significant in the unusual visage of
its determinism. A strong conception of naturalist determinism would
follow Émile Zola’s vision of characters who are “completely dominated
by their nerves and blood, without free will” and events that “are the
proper products of the characters living under given conditions and
cannot at will be changed in their order or kind.”[@mitchell_determined_1989 vii, ix] More recent and
nuanced views of determinism maintain some of these terms without giving
in to them. Lee Clark Mitchell in Determined Fictions, for example,
reframes determinism as a conflict between the naturalist character’s
own self-conception as an “autonomous, integrated, freely willing agent”
and the countervailing narrative strategies that prove such conceptions
to be false; agency becomes largely psychological, while determinism
becomes a narrative, rather than an ontological, premise.[@mitchell_determined_1989 xv] Donald
Pizer is one of the more optimistic voices on the topic of determinism,
seeing in the resistance to “amoral” deterministic forces a
revitalization of “man’s sense of his own dignity and importance.”[@pizer_realism_1984 11]
All these treatments share an understanding of determinism as
unidirectional, with some external “force” always conceived as an agent
of change, and the nature of the human, individually and collectively,
as the thing changed.

Gilman rejects the unidirectionality of this influence. As we have seen,
her coevolutionary system instead presents a form of mutual determinism,
in which human agent and environmental “conditions” influence each
other. The human remains subject to a certain degree of determinism, but
the avowed task of Herlanders individually and collectively is to
transform the forces that determine. In Gilman’s insistent return to the
task of creating an environment that will produce the best children, we
can see a direct intervention into a process of determination that much
naturalist criticism would claim removes free will entirely.
Backgrounding on one hand concedes that humans are as “determined” as
other organisms, placing human and non-human on the same level, but on
the other hand, it puts human actors in the middle of the web of mutual
influence that defines ecology, crossing the boundary of determined
human and determining environment. Humans are *in* the environment and
*of* the environment without being ruled by it. The Darwinian---or,
perhaps more accurately, Spencerian---logics of naturalism are reformed in
ways that trouble the usual constitution of the genre.

It is in the way it reforms this deterministic logic that Gilman’s
naturalism resembles an early vision of the good Anthropocene. The
Anthropocene in any form makes it impossible to maintain the notion of a
unidirectional determination of the human by a dominating environment.
Where the strong determinist reading of naturalist nature is as a
current buffeting a human non-agent that may nevertheless understand the
situation, the Anthropocene proposes a vision of the human altering
natural systems on a vastly outsized scale: human agency outstrips human
understanding. Considered in the terms of naturalism, the Anthropocene
itself can be seen to have, at least in some forms, a deterministic
logic. All of nature is as an apple of Sodom, turning to ash when
plucked. While some triumphalist versions of the good Anthropocene can
be similarly deterministic, in that everything technology touches seems
to turn to gold, more nuanced versions reveal another possibility that
resists the dystopian determinism of pessimistic Anthropocenes and the
triumphal determinism of naïve good Anthropocenes. In these good
Anthropocenes, the human is one actant among many, and the outsized
power of the human can reverse its trend by taking positive actions that
will improve the planetary environment. The key is to destabilize the
human/environment split entirely. To put in Haraway’s terms, though she
refuses the Anthropocene and especially the good Anthropocene as
descriptive concepts: we have reached a moment when “bounded individuals
plus contexts, when organisms plus environments, or genes plus whatever
they need” no longer suffice.[@haraway_staying_2016 30] The good Anthropocene, at least in
visions like Gilman’s, is premised on not just reversing the vector and
charge of determinism but revising the structure of that thought
entirely. Even if the human is conceived as the primary beneficiary of
environmental praxis, neither the human nor a monolithic “environment”
is the sole actant, and the benefit must be mutual to be real.

Though *Herland*’s utopianism and optimistic bent are unique among
naturalist novels, its exploration of an Anthropocenic “nature” may not
be. Even though the traditional understanding of naturalism’s
determinism is its precise inverse, the Anthropocene has given us an
attentiveness to humanity’s pervasive effect on the planet that makes
visible a similar set of concerns in naturalist novels beyond Gilman’s.
*Herland* may just be one example of a genre that was engaged in a
debate that closely mirrors our contemporary one in the extent to which
it took the place of the human in nature as an urgent site of
philosophical contest. Early-twentieth-century evolutionary theory as it
appears in naturalism has to be understood in its historical context as
coeval with the birth of ecology and the conservation movement, rather
than as a purely social-Darwinist conception. If we understand
naturalism less as a coherent movement than
as a phenomenon, a literary response to this moment marked by competing
visions of human-and-nature in science and economics, we can see that
the genre is defined by a diversity of perspectives on the same topic
and in the same time. We might therefore define naturalism less by a
univocal response to this moment than by a peculiar responsive*ness* to
it. Of course, in taking *Herland* as representative of naturalism, we
ignore at our peril the genre’s reputation for “pessimism,” but in this
sense naturalism and the Anthropocene are even more comfortable
bedfellows: Gilman is not unique among naturalists in her relevance to
theory in the Anthropocene, merely in her particular orientation towards
what we would now call the *good* Anthropocene.

Taking this conception of naturalism beyond the context of Gilman’s
work, a few areas of study immediately present themselves. To take one
example, we might note the undercurrent of intensive agriculture in the
works of Jack London, Frank Norris, and Ellen Glasgow as a counterpoint
to the capitalist agricultural methods that
have been the mechanism of Anthropocenic destruction. These authors all
depict the destructive transformations to the American landscape that
comes from exploitative cash-crop agriculture while to varying degrees
presenting the judicious improvement of soil health as a more rational
environmental future. Clover and alfalfa, which improve soil and prevent
erosion, line these texts in ways that only make sense as a resistance
to widespread anthropogenic destruction of the environment. Furthermore,
London’s simultaneous interest in environmental reform and narrating
species as such in his “dog books” and elsewhere is fertile ground for
an investigation into the place of the *anthropos* in this moment of
American environmental thinking. The example of *Herland* might be one
among many suggesting that American literary naturalism can be usefully
understood as part of the long intellectual pre-history of the
Anthropocene---and that in order to be understood as an engagement with
the natural world, it might have to be.

[^57]: For more on systems as a paradigm of production, personhood, and
    society in *Herland*, and more specifically the relevance of
    Frederick Winslow Taylor’s *The Principles of Scientific
    Management*: @fusco_systems_2009.

[^58]: The description of this system as permacultural is less anachronistic than it might seem,
    given that F. H. King's *Farmers of Forty Centuries*, a study of "Permanent Agriculture" in 
    China, Japan, and Korea, was published in 1900.[@king_farmers_1911] There is no evidence to suggest
    that Gilman read King's work, but the concepts were in circulation in America at the time.
    For evidence of another naturalist author interested in King's work and proto-permacultural
    farming methods, see @tichi_jack_2015.

[^61]: Cf. @daly_steady-state_1977.

[^63]: This aspect of the novel has been widely discussed in Gilman
    scholarship, as has the understanding of motherhood as an ecological
    and systemic process. @shishin_gender_1998; @fusco_systems_2009; and @hall_mothers_1989.

[^64]: I allude here to the title of Charles Walcutt's influential mid-century study of 
    naturalism: @walcutt_american_1956. His contention that naturalism is 
    defined by a series of contradictions between, among other things, perspectives
    of hope and despair partially informs my view that naturalism ought to be 
    understood as a competing set of responses to a scientific-historical moment.
