In her utopian novel *Herland* (1915), Charlotte Perkins Gilman creates “a land
in a state of perfect cultivation, where even the forests looked as if they
were cared for; a land that looked like an enormous park, only that it was even
more evidently an enormous garden”; a land with “clean, well-built
roads,…attractive architecture,…[and] ordered beauty”; a land more “petted”
than any before seen (“even in Germany”), in which practically all of the trees
are “[f]ood-bearing” (42-4). It is a world unto itself that blends the built
and natural environments to provide for its people a perfect freedom from
scarcity. The soil has been improved and the wildlife managed with such care
that no farming or harvesting is necessary---the land *provides*, without the
coercion of agricultural labor. Nobody seems to direct the maintenance of this
environment, and yet it is maintained by the effortless and seemingly automatic
contributions of Herland’s people. Some keep careful watch for destructive
elements of the ecology, others construct careful art objects that embody a
culture of environmental care.[^ln-artobjects] Still others run communal eating
houses that completely fulfill Herland's need for meals just as reliably and
evenly as the environment provides the ingredients. This is a society that has
grown together with its environment in mutual sustenance, a garden in which the
human grows in tandem with other organisms, each producing naturally what the
other needs to survive. Herland's forests are not, in other words, the “rank”
and “tangled” vegetation that Gilman sees in the world beyond (67). The land
has evolved beyond competition and into a freedom attainable only through
cooperation.

*Herland* is often read primarily for its "gynaecocentric" (?) evolutionary
theory and its vision of a society populated only of women---and understandably
so; this is the explicit centerpiece of the novel. No less central, but much
less discussed, are the novel's insights into the role of the human activity in
shaping natural systems. The Herland environment is marked by benign but
absolute human control over the natural environment. While there is very little
agriculture or cultivation in the traditional sense, Herlanders have chosen to
retain and support certain elements of the ecosystem while systematically
reducing or removing others, resulting in a food-production system that is able
to persist without maintenance or replanting---more reminiscent of permaculture
than any of the prevailing horticultural models of the time. Herland is a
woman-made Eden, but it is also what Leo Marx calls a "middle landscape," a
place that is symbolically "created by mediation between art and nature,"
eschewing both back-to-the-land primitivism and technological futurism to
create a zone in which nature and culture are mutually supportive.
[@marx_machine_2000 71; see also @chang_economics_2010 342-3] And yet, this
mid-century ecocritical paradigm is not enough to account for *Herland*'s
social-ecological imagination, nor why this imagination should be of concern
now, a century after its publication. The turn in the ecocritical conversation
following the discovery of the Anthropocene allows us to place this marginal
work in a new context, and it also brings Gilman's ideas into clearer focus.

What makes Herland especially relevant to Anthropocene studies in particular is
the fact that this anthropocentric ecological management arises out of a
catastrophic geological event, population pressures, and the limits of a
suddenly full world. Herland is situated on a triangular, “high-standing spur”
rising out of the “dark green sea of crowding forest” around it, isolated and
inaccessible to the rest of the world (41). As one of the Herlanders explains,
it was once open and able to participate in economic and ecological exchange,
but war and an earthquake sealed it off completely two thousand years before
the narration begins [Herland x]. From that moment, it becomes a world in
miniature, an open-air pseudo-biosphere that will support its human population
with the resources available to it or not at all.

In its sudden transition to a closed system, Herland evokes the world that was
beginning to become visible from Gilman's vantage in 1915, when consciousness
of the globe as a trading paradigm was arising in tandem with consciousness of
the planet as an ultimate limit to resource exploitation and growth. Among
naturalists, Norris and Dreiser were especially attuned to the global
consciousness of trade, beginning to narrate the open movement of capital
internationally in *The Pit* and *The Financier*, respectively. The more
general consciousness of this state of affairs, in which capital flowed freely
across borders from about 1870 until it began to be regulated around the time
of the First World War, is evident in the French Chamber of Deputies decision
to outlaw any imports of capital [@streeter_globalization_2010 94-5]. <!--
details come from from histories of globalization... streeter et al.
Globalization and Autonomy; others; see if it would make sense to include
Wenzel Planet Vs. Globe here, need at least footnote for the distinction-->

Of the other consciousness, the *planet* as a final limit, Gilman's isolated
spur of rock is the chief literary representative in this period, drawing from
a reservoir of ecological thinking that would eventually give rise to an
institutionalized conservation movement. Among her most cherished
correspondents and friends was Lester Ward, who, though best known as the
founder of modern sociology, was also a geologist and paleobotanist, at one
time serving as the Chief Paleontologist of the U.S. Geological Survey
[@burnham_lester_1956 2, @ross_man_1975 51]. Ward is on one hand a contributor
to American conservationism, particularly in his work with Major John Wesley
Powell: Ward's mentor and the director of the U.S. Geological Survey, Powell
was an influential early voice of conservation, laying the groundwork for the
Reclamation Act of 1902 and training the scientists who would carry the call
for responsible resource use into the twentieth century [@ross_man_1975 51, 53,
57, 59; see also @stegner_beyond_1992]. But on the other hand, Ward articulates
a vision of the human's place in nature that seems contrary to the spirit of
limitation that has motivated the modern Anthropocene movement. In Ward's view,
the human is both the end-product of evolution and the agent that takes over
where evolution leaves off---both part of nature and the end of it. This
complicated dual role justifies the "laying open of her [nature's] bowels" for
experimentation, an explicitly Baconian perspective that understands the human
as the rightful "master" of non-human organisms and processes
[@ward_dynamic_1926 11-2]. The Wardian view of nature promotes absolute mastery
without exploitation---Prometheanism in the name of stewardship.[^prometheanism]

[^prometheanism]: explain prometheanism; use robinson article.

The same perspective can be attributed to Gilman. Ward had a great influence on
Gilman's thinking in the composition of *Herland*, as Cynthia J. Davis has
shown [@davis_his_2003]. But for Gilman, "influence" is more visible and
determinative than it might be for other authors. In *The Man-Made World, or
Our Androcentric Culture*, Gilman articulates a vision of engaged fiction that
would forward the ideas of other works, "teach[ing] not by preaching but by
truly re-presenting" [qtd. in @davis_his_2003 73]. This is an effective summary
of her approach in *Herland*. While the sociological and evolutionary elements
of this influence have been discussed by Davis and others, Ward's ecological
thinking had no less of a role in forming Gilman's novel. She does not
reproduce Ward's thinking exactly, however. Rather, her fictional extrapolation
of his theories in *Herland* dramatizes a tension between absolute limits of and
absolute control over the planet and its processes. 

This tension between limitation and control has hardly been resolved in the
century since *Herland* first appeared in Gilman's self-published monthly
journal, *The Forerunner*. To read *Herland* ecocritically now, in the dawn not
of the Anthropocene but of our consciousness of it, is to recognize this
enclosed garden civilization as a fictional laboratory for the scientific,
sociological, and ethical issues that define thinking about the Anthropocene.
More specifically, her and Ward's ambivalence regarding the status of the human
in nature---to put it somewhat reductively, either as destroyer or
savior---prefigures a contemporary controversy over the possibility of a "good
Anthropocene." Both center on the same question: should our absolute control
over non-human nature be understood as a justified evolutionary step, or does
the very premise of absolute control violate the material and ethical
limitations of the planet? [need to contextualize why I'm about to go on this
little journey in terms of Gilman?]

The former perspective is at the heart of any robust defense of the "good
Anthropocene." At its most basic, the "good Anthropocene" movement is what it
sounds like. It suggests that there is some version of the Anthropocene that
would result not in catastrophe for humans and non-human nature, and that
embracing human guidance of the planetary ecology could ultimately be
beneficial for all involved. There are many visions of what a "good"
Anthropocene would mean, but they come together in rejecting the catastrophic
or "dystopian" visions of our environmental future, seeking instead ways to use
technological and social innovations to reduce further damage and even repair
the damage that has been done---to turn the Anthropocene into "a more just,
prosperous, and ecologically diverse" epoch. The most radical and controversial
articulation of the "good Anthropocene," and probably the most widely
circulated, has been "An Ecomodernist Manifesto" (2015). The signatories of the
manifesto argue that the route to "decoupling human development from
environmental impacts" is (counterintuitively and, many would say,
counterfactually) "intensifying many human activities---particularly farming,
energy extraction, forestry, and settlement." Concentrating these activities in
smaller areas, they reason, will allow us to leave more land completely wild;
but their emphasis is always on the Promethean faith in humanity's ability to
tinker its way out of any limitations, or in their words, "putting humankind's
extraordinary powers" to work. In short, they celebrate human technological
triumphs over nature, rehearsing a familiar narrative of a liberatory
technology that frees humanity from the drudgery of agricultural
labor.[^ln-ecomodern-responses] 

[^ln-ecomodern-responses]: The responses to this manifesto will be discussed in
more detail later, but have tended to bring existing critiques of modernism to
bear on this new instantiation of it. The apparent ease with which the
Anthropocene is able to become a "good" thing elides differential risk and
responsibility as well as a long history of disenfranchisement from land and
resources. Ecomodernism, in other words, is just a way to prop up a facile
progressivism in green clothing. See Latour, Crist, and Collard et al.

The Ecomoderns should not be taken as the sole representatives of the "good
Anthropocene," however, by either the concept's supporters or its
critics. Other approaches to the concept are less comfortable with this
triumphalism, focusing more on the need to resist catastrophism and to promote
forms of resilience and transition instead. In the words of Bennett et al.
(2016), "The future does not have to be bleak. ...Whether or not one agrees
with these [dystopian] characterizations, extrapolations of current,
maladaptive trends into a bleak future run the risk of becoming
self-fulfilling, because people base their actions on what they believe about
society and their future" (441). They continue to offer a range of solutions
that acknowledge the need for social and economic transition to a greater
degree than the authors of "An Ecomodernist Manifesto," creating a database of
"seeds" (initiatives) in a taxonomy of approaches and areas of intended impact.
While unlikely to evade social and environmentalist critique, this version of
the "good Anthropocene" at least includes new forms of "equitable opportunities
for decision making" in its range of goals, as well as initiatives that explore
ways to repurpose traditional sustainable agriculture techniques (443-5). It
is, in other words, a "good Anthropocene" that leans on plurality rather than
a universalist progressive narrative.

And yet, even the pluralist "good Anthropocene" leaves unanswered the most
fundamental questions of ethical and material limitations to a "progress"
premised on human domination of nature. Ethically, the good Anthropocene is
defined by the old (but undismissable) problem of anthropocentrism. As Bruno
Latour points out in his response, the Manifesto "is written entirely as if
humans were still alone on stage, the only being who out of its own free will
is in charge of apportioning space, land, money and value to the old Mother
Nature....[T]he ecomodernists are also *uchronists*, as if they were living at
a time when they alone were in command" (223). On the contrary, the
Anthropocene "modifies the scale, the speed, the rhythm and, more importantly,
the distribution of active agents in any political conversation we have about
the entanglement of humans and non-humans" (222-3). In this version of the
Anthropocene, more redolent of the Anthropocene conversation in general, the
centrality of humans to the epoch does not bespeak absolute control. Rather, at
center stage is the rapidity with which human action, whether intentional or
a product simply of scale, can influence non-human organisms and communities in
ways we could never predict, let alone hope to marshal. The recognition of this
kind of entanglement has compelled Donna Haraway to set aside the Anthropocene
moniker entirely in favor of what she calls the "Chthulucene," a "name for the
dynamic ongoing sym-chthonic forces and powers of which people are a part" and
which demands "intense commitment and collaborative work and play with other
[non-human] terrans" (160). The problem with even imagining the level of
control Ecomoderns assume out of hand is that it hubristically simplifies these
entanglements, reducing a vast multitude of actors to a single, determining
one. 

The ethical problem of entanglement quickly becomes a matter of cold, wet fact,
however, as recognizing this multitude of actors determines how one sees the
material limitations to economic growth. Among the Manifesto's most peculiar
claims is that "there is still remarkably little evidence that human population
and economic expansion will outstrip the capacity to grow food or procure
critical material resources in the foreseeable future." This notion can only be
maintained within the limited frame of the economist's graph. As Eileen Crist
points out, the Manifesto only admits for evidence certain "insuperable
obstacle[s]" to growth, "such as a hard agronomic boundary in food production
or the depletion of some indispensable and non-substitutable resource" (251).
These variables leave out the very real disappearance of biodiversity in an
unheard of scale, mass extinctions on a scale that would usually be understood
as an epoch-defining catastrophe. As Crist reminds us, "mass extinction does
not have a technical solution" (250-1, 247). And yet even the economist's
variables should not be so easily passed over. Absolute agronomic limits may
not have been encountered yet, but rapid ecological collapses in response to
climate change could bring those limits rapidly into play. 

Gilman, in her extrapolations on Ward's theories and in her own right, should
be seen as part of the deep philosophical history of the "good Anthropocene,"
both in its vision of human control as an evolutionary imperative and in the
ethical problems it embodies. In some ways, however, her foundation surpasses
both Ward and the contemporary "good Anthropocene" arguments a century later.
Gilman's version of a good Anthropocene is premised on a web of mutual
determination among physical environment, the economic base, and social
structure, arguing for a more nuanced understanding of "progress" that relies
on refinement rather than growth. [ Details, write this up after I've written
the chapter ]. Despite this apparent foresight, however, it also foreshadows
the hubris and ethical problems that mar the very notion of a "good"
Anthropocene a century later. [ More details, on population control, consensus,
and anthropocentric ethics ] These contradictions cut to the heart of the
naturalist philosophy in the way they deal with environmental determinism.
Granting the fundamental premise of determinism, she complicates it by placing
the human at both ends of the equation, as both a guide for the "forces" that
determine ecological development and one of many elements of the system those
forces determine. This principle of codetermination constitutes a form of
Utopian Naturalism that both characterizes the contemporary good Anthropocene
debate and exposes its philosophical limits.

[^ln-artobjects]: Need to confirm and cite.

[Though the most popular of her novels, *Herland* remains somewhat marginal
outside of Gilman scholarship. Critics often prefer the narrative richness and
psychological focus of “The Yellow Wallpaper” (1892), the story of a woman
whose confinement to the home, embodied in the design of the titular wallpaper,
drives her to madness. The plot of *Herland*, in contrast, is in many ways
traditional utopian fare in the vein of Thomas More, Edward Bellamy, or William
Morris. The three male protagonists, Vandyck (the narrator), Terry, and Jeff,
discover a country that has been lost to the rest of the world for two thousand
years, a civilization entirely of women who reproduce parthenogenetically: each
woman conceives asexually unless she wills herself not to. After a brief
imprisonment and an abortive escape attempt, the men are assimilated into the
society of Herland and set about learning its ways. They discover a system of
ecological socialism that emphasizes the efficient use of resources and rewards
social duty over individual achievement, and is defined above all by communal
motherhood as a social paradigm as well as a basis for a social ecology. 

Just readng the predominant criticism of Herland, though, one would be forgiven
for overlooking the novel's relevance to social ecology and ecocriticism.
*Herland* was unearthed in 1979 **(confirm!! look at the sources again!)** from
the archived anonymity of Gilman's self-published journal *The Forerunner*
primarily because of its discussion of gender. It was a proto-feminist work
that had been buried along with the work of many other women whose thinking was
well ahead of their generation's, and only some seventy years after its
composition could it assume its rightful place in (or at least near) the
American literary canon.[^feminist-revival] The problem, though, was the
novel's conservativism in comparison with the critical projects that might be
expected to champion it: if *Herland* was written too early to be well
received, it was rediscovered too late. After an initial critical interest in
the project, the work was rightly deemed not particularly useful to feminism as
it stood. The "matriarchy" Gilman glorifies is a little too heavy on
motherhood, and by the 1980s, to celebrate such a society as "feminist" would
have been to accept a massive step backwards---not to mention the undercurrents
of eugenics and racial nationalism that rightly revile modern readers.
*Herland*, then, is useful as a historical snapshot of an early utopian
feminist thinker, but it is showing its age, too much so to be held up as
anything but a very complicated model.[^feminist-reception]]

This critical history, necessarily somewhat reduced, obscures a less dominant
strand of Gilman's thinking that is no less exciting, and potentially of much
greater use---and it is evident in the representation of the novel with which I
began. Gilman's speculative world can be reconsidered as an example of the
American ecotopian imagination: a process by which speculative social ecologies
develop in response to the divide between human systems and the ecologies that
contain them. Beneath the main line of *Herland*'s feminist argument there is
an equally serious set of premises concerning the imbrication of economy and
ecology, built environment with natural environment, and human evolution with
the evolution of the earth. Following these subtle arguments to their
conclusion can offer a new reading of the novel as one of transition from a
state of civilization-as-we've-known-it to a steady-state human ecology in
perfect harmony: a society that has organized itself from below to pursue
*development without growth*. In short, it is worth taking up *Herland* again
now to ask if it can be more useful to the environmental humanities today than
it was for feminism in the '80s.

The short answer is that it certainly can be. Gilman was writing from and to a
considerably less full world than the one we have now, and yet she seems to be
thinking through the full-world problems most characteristic of the the later
twentieth century and beyond. Several viewpoints from the other side of
Gilman's century seem to describe a basis for her project almost perfectly.
Carolyn Merchant's *Radical Ecology*, for example, sees two fundamental
"contradictions" in the ecological moment of 1989, the first arising "from
tensions between the economic forces of production and local ecological
conditions, the second from tensions between reproduction and production" (9).
In *Herland*, as I will show, resolving both contradictions becomes part of a
single process in which human production *and* reproduction are considered as
part of the same economy, and also as part of the regional ecology. The urgent
awareness of the Anthropocene has shown the necessity for human development to
be understood in terms of its influence on planetary development---for, as
Dipesh Chakrabarty puts it, we "now wield a geological force"
[@chakrabarty_climate_2009 206]; Gilman's Herlanders anticipate a cultural
solution to this problem long before its terms became clear, understanding
their existence in terms of *coexistence*, their evolution as *coevolution*.
And now, when it is becoming clear that environmental justice is often
inseparable from economoic justice,[^environmental-social-economic-justice]
*Herland* puts forward one model of a systemic address to both, even if she
forces us to ask important and challenging questions about the ethics and
viability of her solution.

[^environmental-social-economic-justice]: Merchant, Adamson, Env justice reader

Now, then, is the right moment to put *Herland* in the context of the joint
ecological and economic crises that have defined most of the hundred-year
interval between 1915 and the present. Doing so will hardly constitute the
first environmental reading of *Herland*, for there are several accomplished
precedents.[^prior-art] But to ask "Why this reading now?" demands a particular
response: it demands that one ask what alternatives *Herland* posits, what
economic and ecological systems it concocts in its speculative, ecotopian
crucible and how they fit in after more than a century's development in
environmental thinking. It demands that the novel be read in the interstices of
ecology and economics then and now. 

[^ln-prior-art]: Esp. chang, Fleissner

In what follows, I will argue that Charlotte Perkins Gilman uses the garden as
a framing device to depict a system in which management of environment replaces
the market cycle of production and consumption, collective sustenance becomes
the end-goal of the economy, and the human coevolves (both culturally and
literally) with its environment. After exposing how Gilman uses world
construction as a mode of ecotopian argumentation, I will show that the
ecological entanglement of built and natural environments creates a garden
economy in which labor, subsumed into being, ceases to be an exploitative
activity, and vitality becomes the mechanism and end-goal of the economy. In
the second section, I will argue that this relationship to the environment
leads to a coevolutionary system in which biological determinism, environmental
determinism, and education all contribute to a growing-together of humanity
with nature. This process, as I will show, can be most effectively understood
in its similarity to the Marxian “metabolism” of town and
country.[^ln-marxism-gilman] I will conclude by returning to my initial
question---What does *Herland* offer to the environmental humanities now as a
text of transition to a post-fossil fuel economy and ecology?---and pointing to
some of the environmental valences of Gilman's particular utopian brand of
literary naturalism.

[^ln-marxism-gilman]: With this part of the argument, I hope to question the
general silence between Marxist criticism and Gilman scholarship. Walter Benn
Michaels’s reading of “The Yellow Wallpaper” in *The Gold Standard and the
Logic of Literary Naturalism* is an immediate and notable exception to this
silence. 

### The Garden and the Full World

In this light, what rises to the fore of Gilman's utopia is the notion that a
society can be organized according the principles of a garden. For much of her
life, Gilman kept a garden of her own---a “vegetable garden mind you!, not
merely flowers”---at one point as a means of subsistence in the lean years of
her later life, at another as what she referred to as a “sanitarium” (*Selected
Letters* 180, 281, 284). The relevance of subsistence gardens to *Herland* is
clear: in all its appearances in the novel, the garden is a space that is
simultaneously built and natural, a source of food and material goods that is
neither agricultural nor industrial and yet is not entirely distinct from
either. 

Though this blending can certainly be seen (and has been before) as an example
of what Leo Marx has termed "the middle landscape,"[^ln-chang] it
insufficiently accounts for the complexities of Gilman's ecotopian paradigm. A
materialist focus in Gilman's version of the garden as well as her focus on
communal labor and communal governance brings out the social and
infrastructural import Marx's paradigm obscures. Unlike @marx's middle
landscape, Gilman's garden is conceived as a commons, a public space whose
maintenance and ownership are shared by all members of society. The communal
construction of environment her paradigm implies includes the communal
construction of culture, and as such it is central to all aspects of life in
Herland. Gilman's garden would therefore be better considered in terms of Joni
Adamson's understanding of the "garden ethic" and "garden metaphor," which she
derives from the work of Simon Ortiz and Leslie Marmon Silko as well as Acoma
oral tradition [@adamson 68, 183, 57]. 

[^ln-chang]: Cf. Li-Wen @chang_economics_2010's "Economics, Evolution, and
Feminism in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Utopian Fiction" (343).

Admittedly, Adamson lands on a paradigm that sounds very similar to Leo Marx's,
as it defines a meeting place between the natural and the cultural, the human
and the environment. She even refers to it throughout the book as "the middle
place," although there appear to be no explicit references between her model
and Marx's. But where Marx's middle landscape is predicated on
expansionism,[^ln-marx-expansionism] Adamson seeks garden ethics like Ortiz's
that "[teach] us to live more responsibly in the specific places we inhabit,"
and her version of the gardener "endeavors to understand how nature's
large-scale patterns work in specific places" [@adamson 68, 184]. The emphasis
on the local and responsibility to one's immediate environment is an
inexcludable criterion in approaching a society defined by strict geographic
limitations, as Herland is. Just as crucially, Adamson's garden is a place
where nature and culture do not just meet and blend, but are actually mutually
determining. Nature guided by cultural practices is still admitted as nature,
but she also attends carefully to the ways in which the "Acoma people," for
example, "come to understand the natural world through working in their
gardens," leading to a relationship in which "culture emerges from nature"
(53). Conditions of scarcity, both in historical and speculative terms, demand
a greater degree of attention to the way that culture adapts to nature, not
just the reverse.

[^ln-marx-expansionism]: edenic garden depends on plenty; jefferson; etc.

Adamson's version of the middle landscape is so useful as a way of considering
*Herland*, then, not merely because it opens up the garden as a space of
interaction between human and non-human environments---Leo Marx also does that.
Rather, Adamson's garden lets us think of the garden explicitly as a continuum
of materiality and cultural forms that is a fundamental part of Gilman's
ecotopian vision. It not only *lets* us consider this continuum: it demands
that we do so in response to the realities of a steady-state or closed system.

The economy of Herland is perhaps the aspect of this society most transformed
by the garden's material-cultural logics, and it is therefore the clearest
angle from which to see its peculiarities and complex structure. One passage,
in which a Herlander describes realizing her place in the community and with
respect to the environment, defines especially clearly the general shape of the
Herlanders' relationship with environment, and it is particularly revealing of
the way that relationship determines the nature of the economy and the status
of labor:

> “It was a butterfly that made me a forester,” said Ellador. “I was about eleven
years old, and I found a big purple and green butterfly on a low flower. I
caught it, very carefully, by the closed wings, as I had been told to do, and
carried it to the nearest insect teacher---” (I [Vandyck] made a note there to
ask her what on earth an insect teacher was) “to ask her its name. She took it
from me with a little cry of delight. ‘Oh, you blessed child…. This is a female
of the obernut moth,’ she told me, ‘they are almost gone. We have been trying
to exterminate them for centuries. If you had not caught this one, it might
have laid eggs enough to raise worms enough to destroy thousands of our nut
trees---thousands of bushels of nuts,---and make years and years of trouble for
us.’…I grew a foot, it seemed to me, and determined then and there to be a
forester.” (123)

On the narrative level, this passage reverses the expectation of total,
unquestioned conservationism in all cases, disclosing instead the ideology of
environmental management more typical of forestry.[^ln-forestry] The tender,
careful handling of the frail creature will ultimately culminate, we realize,
in the its death, as well as the last stage in a deliberate extinction of the
entire species. This reversal effectively replaces uncomplicated reverence for
the "natural world" with a commitment to transform the “natural” into the
system that most benefits humans. Understanding that the obernut moth limits
the propagation of the obernut, and realizing that the obernut is Herland’s
“best food-nut,” they create a situation in which nurturing the environment
they have crafted will mean nurturing themselves (123). But the means of this
ecological management also contains some of the basic problematics of a Herland
forestry more broadly conceived. They hardly seem to blink at the forced
extinction of a species for the benefit of the human Herlanders. If *Herland*
would be less than palatable to sentimental, bourgeois conservationism, it
would be anathema to the deep ecologist's fundamental axiom: the inherent value
of every living thing, regardless of its use as a resource.

[^ln-forestry]: Forestry from Leopold, Merchant

The full world determines not only the Herlanders' management of their
"resources," but their very self-conception. Their system of ecological
management reaches beyond direct interactions between the human and environment
as in the treatment an obernut moth, determining also the human concepts of
labor, professional identity, and the economy. The forester, Ellador, is
telling the story of her professional self-realization---the moment when she
conceives of herself in terms of her role in the economy---but the nature of
the work is such that this moment is inseparable from the realization of her
place (albeit by way of a larger system) in the *ecology*. Considered in terms
of labor, a “forester” such as Ellador is a peculiar entity: she is not quite
an agricultural producer, and yet her actions contribute to the sufficient
supply of food. She is not exactly employed by the state, and yet her function
to the community is clear. Her duties are framed in terms of maintaining the
environment, and yet in doing so she is also maintaining herself---both
materially, by providing food for herself and others, and psychologically, by
coming into her identity. The mutually determining cultural and material forms
take labor as their point of confluence, the site of their mutual
determination.[^ln-ambient-labor-preview]

[^ln-ambient-labor-preview]: This concept will be elaborated further in the
"Ambient Labor" section below.

The ambiguity of this form of labor (can taking care of oneself be considered
*labor*?) is resolved by understanding the way the garden structure is applied
to an economic system. What I am calling *Herland*'s "garden economy" comes
into focus when the labor actually performed by Herlanders is taken into
account on the level of the entire society: it is a system in which the thing
produced is environment, not commodity; in which, as a result, production and
consumption disappear as discrete entities; and which culminates in the gradual
subsumption of labor into being.

One result of this collapse of environmental production into self-sustenance is
that the perpetuation of society through procreation becomes an economic
activity---and thereby seems to offer a resolution to Merchant's "second
contradiction" between production and reproduction some seventy years before
Merchant identified it. As she does more directly elsewhere in nonfiction
writings like *Women and Economics* (1898), in *Herland* Gilman presents
motherhood as an economically valuable contribution to the collective. It is
also, as is crucial in her system, depersonalized, and is therefore subject to
division of labor just like every other economic activity.[^ln-systems-prior]
When a division of economic labor is expanded to include ecology, though---what
an ecological economist might call ecological services and ecological
labor---incorporating human reproduction into the economic division of labor
also subsumes it into the managed regional ecology. In this context, the
magical, parthenogenetic reproductive capacity (*Herland*'s main speculative
conceit) is explicable less as a product of divine intervention than as an
extension of the garden economy. Reproduction in the desired proportions takes
on the same inevitability and automatism of production, becoming a feature of
carefully (and communally) controlled conditions rather than a sum of
uncoordinated individual choice.

[^ln-systems-prior]: This aspect of the novel has been much discussed in Gilman
scholarship, as has the understanding of motherhood as an ecological and
systemic process. See Alex Shishin’s “Gender and Industry in Herland,”
Katherine Fusco’s “Systems, Not Men: Producing People in *Herland*,” and K.
Graehme Hall’s “Mothers and Children: ‘Rising with the Restless Tide’ in
*Herland*.”

Gilman extends the mutual determination of nature and culture to its logical
conclusion by exploring a process of literal and cultural *coevolution*, not
between two discreet species of organism (as commonly occurs in the non-human
natural world), but between the human and its environment entire. The
evolutionary system that Gilman accepts is an idiosyncratic one. In line with
the rest of the slippage between organism and environment in the novel, she
assumes a semi-Lamarckian stance of species development that emphasizes the
role of environment in physical evolution. Like Lamarck, she considers the
possibility that acquired traits can be passed on to other generations, which
gives environmental determinants an outsized influence on the development of a
species. Taking environment as a significant determining factor in evolution
also brings the creation of culture into the evolutionary equation: Gilman uses
education, a fundamental part of the Herland culture, as a way to guide the
management of the physical environment, depicting a society that, in
determining its environment’s development, simultaneously guides its *own*
development. The resultant coevolutionary system foregrounds the interaction of
the human with the natural world in its conception of a continued human
evolution. By depicting this process as a result of social reform and control
of the built environment, Gilman frames her work as well as that of her
contemporary feminist reformers as interventions in the evolutionary process.
She goes further still in illustrating the dialectical evolutionary paradigm
that enables the existence of *Herland* in what should be conditions of extreme
scarcity. 

Simply put, Gilman has developed a garden system that is able to operate in
conditions of extreme spatial and ecological limitation by rejecting the
concomitance of growth and development and refusing the separation of human and
non-human systems, whether those systems are flows of energy, ecological
systems, or even evolutionary ones. In the following sections, the specifics of
how she incorporates human labor into an ecology (both socially and materially)
will be expanded upon significantly. But to discuss a vision of near-total
environmental determinism like this one, discussing social structures requires
a discussion of the speculative world itself---and in this case, how the
construction of that world constitutes a type of argumentation.

### World-Building as Argumentation

Some more detail is in order about the work and the environment it depicts,
because in narrative terms, the landscape of *Herland* works as quite a bit
more than background. As in many utopian novels, the author provides a detailed
description of the physical world as a way of (quite literally) preparing the
ground for the social arguments that are to come by prefiguring those arguments
in the land itself---and even using the land itself as a kind of argument.
Gilman's is a particularly cartographical description, delivered as the three
male protagonists view Herland from a biplane, hoping to get “the lay of the
land” before they descend (41). This vantage point allows them to see in one
glance an argument in the terrain itself, though they do not recognize it as
such. World construction is carefully controlled, in Gilman's narrative, to
create the kind of "nature" that she is most interested in discussing.

The most obvious physical feature of Herland is its strict physical containment
by natural boundaries. From above, they see that the land is confined to a
triangular “high-standing spur” rising out of the “dark green sea of crowding
forest” around it (41). The sense of obstruction established by the imposing
forest is reinforced on the far end by “white-crowned peaks in the distance,
themselves probably inaccessible.” The bounds of Herland are clearly defined,
and with them the scope of the systems that define it. Their cultural and
economic isolation is assumed, but so, to a certain extent, is their ecological
sequestration. The natural disaster that locks the Herlanders into a kind of
natural terrarium also, presumably, prevents other life from interacting with
life outside of Herland. In other words, the same factors that keep Herland off
the map make it a distinct bioregion---a term that implies both infrastructural
and natural physical features.[^bioregionalism]

Gilman also quietly keeps the closest thing to wilderness out of the way of
nature that is useful. Natural proliferation is not allowed to interfere with
daily life. Turning to the land itself from its boundaries, she says, “It
appeared to be well forested about the edges, but in the interior there were
wide plains, and everywhere parklike meadows and open places”; in addition,
“closely cultivated gardens” mark the interior plains (42, 47). Vandyck notes
the presence of cities without giving a sense of their number or spatial
orientation, but there are indications later that similar small cities are
spread throughout the country.[^ln-small-cities] As one might expect, there is
not one single, sprawling urban center to Herland, nor the corresponding
relationship to urban and rural divisions of labor. Instead, there appear to be
small towns in a loosely unified political relationship. For this loose
associative structure to work as a nationalized unit in the apparent absence of
any transportation technology, natural barriers in the interior have to be kept
to a minimum. The relegation of the forest to the edges of Herland, then, is
important both symbolically and practically. It maintains the marginality that
is part of the forest's essential cultural or symbolic character---it is still
as far from urban space as one is able to go---but in this case the careful
management also prevents the trees from impeding travel through the interior.
This practical function is underscored by the presence of “clean, well-built
roads,” the unhindered view from “the edge of the open country” through field
glasses, and the speed with which three Herlanders on foot are able to distance
themselves from the male intruders (42, 47). Open space combines with
infrastructural, visual, and physical links to unite the disparate groups of
Herlanders apparently contained in clusters of semiautonomous urban spaces. 

[^ln-small-cities]: See, for example, the men’s lecture circuit
partway through the novel (109-11). 

This deliberate organization of the land into forest, open space, and urban
space is foregrounded from the beginning, and it is partially this division,
the strategic use and removal of impediments, that gives Vandyck the sense that
the land “looked like an enormous park, only that it was even more evidently an
enormous garden” (42). The organization also subtly introduces the entirely
managed character of the country, and establishes from the beginning a
teleological understanding of space---of a land that is constructed for a
purpose, in contrast to actual wilderness. A doubling of world construction
unique to the utopian novel is in evidence here, and it takes on a clear
function when considered as an ecotopian paradigm: perspectives on the land are
reified in the way that interaction with the land occurs, and in this case, in
the way in which the land is shaped. Such shaping happens physically for the
Herlanders, but for Gilman it is almost a rhetorical shaping that is merely
rendered as setting. 

### Ambient Labor

[**Get Hegel in there? Hegel, self-consciousness section, "Fear" on the
construction of the thing as a form of communal self-consciousness.**]

What is for Gilman a mode of argumentation is, for the Herlanders, a principle
of living. The whole of their culture and economy is mediated by the land and
their influence on it. When they work, they work *on* the land, and not just in
the locative sense: it is the object and product of their labor, both the raw
and refined material. Further, working on the land in this way is their means
of working on themselves as an intentional society. The solution to the
ever-present problem of resource distribution is solved by a Bellamy-like
nationalization of the economy with a very un-Bellamy-like casual
application.[^bellamy] There are no chits for a determined allocation of goods,
in other words, but merely an automatic provision by the environment itself.
Everything is like an apple on the branch, waiting to be plucked. There is also
no rigid allocation of tasks, for everyone in some sense is working on the same
thing---again, on Herland itself. Everyone finds their way to a task according
to their inclination, and all of these tasks are understood according to their
influence on the material and social ecology. As a whole, these subtle changes
institute a new paradigm for both sides of the economic equation. Instead of a
market cycle or the capitalist working day, a state of ambient production and
consumption governs the rhythms of Herland.  [The ambiguity in the term
*ambient* is intentional here: the task is everpresent and goes largely
unnoticed as such; the product of labor itself is also ambient in that
environment itself is the thing produced and consumed.]

The evidence of ambient labor is to be found in the setting itself and the way
in which it is "cultivated"---as with the object of labor, it is never the
single crop that is cultivated, but the entire system. There is no purely built
or purely natural environment. Only the liminal space, unique to Herland,
between produced and wild. Nowhere is this contrast of cultivated natural space
with actual wildness more evident than within the forest itself, where it is
underscored by the voiced amazement of the three male outsiders. In Vandyck’s
initial impressions, he points out with astonishment that “even the forests
looked as if they were cared for” (42). Later, Terry says, “I never saw a
forest so petted, even in Germany. Look, there’s not a dead bough---the vines
are trained---actually!...[The trees are f]ood-bearing, practically all of
them....  The rest splendid hard-wood. Call this a forest? It’s a truck farm!”
(44). The word “cultivated” is repeated many times with reference to every
aspect of the landscape, flora and fauna alike, as well as the tiny gardens
that dot the open plains---at one point the forests are referred to simply as
“the cultivated area” (66). The forested area is not the tangled thicket,
wilderness embodied, as it is in the world beyond. It is instead the
breadbasket of the rest of the country, or as Terry puts it, a “truck farm."
This somewhat dated term indicates by definition produce grown for
non-commercial purposes, via definitions of “truck” as bartered (and thus
non-market) goods (“truck,” *OED*). The agricultural system encompasses the
economic system, not the other way around.

What might be seen as an idealistic and utopian model is, in narrative context,
just the most rational response to extreme scarcity. The exclusive localism and
closed-system dynamics that I am arguing can be useful to the twenty-first
centur are forced on the Herlanders so suddenly that it almost extinguishes
them: there used to be free passage to the sea, but natural disasters close it
off conclusively and limit them only to what they can produce in their regional
ecology (81). In these conditions, the market system fails. The cultivation the
Herlanders develop instead is therefore associated with subsistence in the
absence of market-based distribution of goods. Just as the land has shifted in
reality in response to the capitalist system of agriculture, it is evident that
the Herland ecology has developed in mutual codetermination with what is at
first conditions of extreme scarcity but becomes, under the guidance of a
developing ambient labor, the conditions of post-scarcity. The forest is a
case-study in the resulting environment, as the *usefulness* that defines it is
what has allowed the Herlanders to flourish on a “little shut-in piece of land
where one would have thought an ordinary people would have been starved out
long ago or reduced to an annual struggle for life” (104). The non-market
interaction of cultivation and wildness has lifted the Herlanders out of simple
necessity, making plenty and freedom from scarcity a constitutive element of
the wilderness.[^ln-wilderness-scarcity]

[^ln-wilderness-scarcity]: Li-Wen Chang also notes this peculiar character of
the wilderness, saying that “nature and culture nurture each other” in the
Gilman’s environment. Through a reading of Leo Marx’s *The Machine in the
Garden* (1964), she argues that Herland constitutes a “‘middle landscape’…where
machine meets landscape, where the two opposing forces, technological and
pastoral, contact and compromise which each other” (343). In a similarly
technological reading, Katherine Fusco argues in “Systems, Not Men: Producing
People in Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s *Herland*” that “Gilman dissolves the
distinction between biological and mechanical reproduction through her
insistence that the proper way to understand a person is as both product and
part of a system” (427).

Their relationship to their environment also changes the nature of consumption,
which gradually has to account for the availability of every necessary good.
The way this peculiar coexistence of the managed and the natural affects
consumption patterns is revealed during the men’s attempt to escape captivity:
Vandyck says, “Mighty lucky it was that we could live off the country as we
did. Even that margin of forest seemed rich in food-stuffs” (67). On one hand,
the idea of living “off the country” invokes an inapplicable paradigm of
hunter-gatherer like woodsmanship, a product of Vandyck’s own misunderstanding
of the nature of Herland's environment. But what his statement also underscores
is that the land itself has become a kind of pantry without ceasing to be an
exterior space. Consumption in Herland is rendered as an interaction with
environment and “the land,” but the possibility of “liv[ing] off” it does not
constitute an achievement as it might in a survivalist wilderness adventure.
Instead, the land provides. Interestingly, plentiful access to resources leaves
the act of consumption largely un-narrated here and throughout the novel.
Except for the passing reference to the “obernut” in Ellador’s tale of
professional identification, Gilman does not describe the presumably unique
products of this foreign ecosystem. The eliding, collective reference to
“food-stuffs” is paradigmatic of her references to food in general: it is never
more than a category, an acknowledge necessity. In Herland one seems to *find*
food without searching for it, eliminating in the same stroke the array of
choices that defines consumerism and the struggle to attain sustenance that
defines survivalism. This is the sense in which consumption in *Herland* is
"ambient." Vandyck’s easy “liv[ing] off the country” sets the tone for all
references to consumption in *Herland*---the depiction of plenty without waste,
of the immediate satisfaction of wants by goods that are always already at
hand, recurs throughout.[^ln-consumption-nakedness]

[^ln-consumption-nakedness]:See also the resolution of the men’s nakedness by
perfectly fitting, perfectly functional, and deliberately anti-fashionable
clothing when they awake as prisoners (55)] 

The corresponding change in the production paradigm is more difficult to trace.
Any attempt to describe the industry of Herland leads one to ask: What do the
Herlanders actually produce?[^ln-shishin] The only tenable answer is that they
produce their environment, and solely their environment. This is no system of
industrialized agriculture, but more of a totalizing permaculture. When Vandyck
learns more about the cultivation that constitutes “foresting” as a profession,
he discovers that the process entails less planting of produce than creation of
a desirable environment entire. In some cases this has led to “the deliberate
replanting of an entire forest area with different kinds of trees”---an
unimaginably vast displacement that nevertheless results in a functioning
ecosystem, and one that, with respect to the needs of the Herland people, has
been improved (104). In many other cases, environmental improvement runs still
deeper, creating ecological balance in a system that includes the built
environment and urban space. The way their built and natural environments
relate can be deduced by certain absences in Herland's development. The lack of
industrialization, for one, implies that their waste material will be of a kind
that can return to the cycles from which it came. Most of the byproducts of
their production can probably just be composted. Indeed, the attention given to
soil conditions suggests that it almost certainly is: Gilman specifies that “an
increasingly valuable soil [is] built, instead of the progressive
impoverishment so often seen in the rest of the world” (105). The development
of the environment is allowed to proceed without direct human activity, but the
conditions are set such that this natural development adheres to a desirable
course. The environment that determines this growth (the soil) is altered so
that development is both bolstered and guided by the combination of Herland’s
natural and built environments. As a result, the only necessary human
intervention is too incidental to be understood as labor---as is the case for
Ellador, the forester discussed in the introduction. In the case of the
production of soil, the main place of intervention is in via byproducts of
consumption---compostable scraps and human excrement---which come with
necessary vital processes. Composting and waste management are defined by
systemic interventions that either leverage or strategically prevent the
natural activity of the ecosystem’s organisms. Instead of understanding
production on the level of the product, they produce process; where the rapidly
industrializing society of 1915 America was defined by systems of production,
Gilman’s alternative opts for the production of systems.[^ln-fusco]

[^ln-fusco]: For more on systems as a paradigm of production, personhood, and
society in *Herland*, and more specifically the relevance of Frederick Winslow
Taylor’s *The Principles of Scientific Management*, see Katherine Fusco’s
“Systems, Not Men.”] 

[^ln-shishin]: Alex Shishin also asks this question, with a different but
related answer: “If such an industrial base exists in Herland, we do not see
it, nor hear or smell it. The same pleasant condition---a pronounced lack of
industrial pollution and ugliness---is present in the two seminal utopian
novels which preceded Herland: Edward Bellamy's *Looking Backward* (1888) and
William Morris's *News from Nowhere* (1890). But while Bellamy and Morris offer
explanations for this, Gilman does not” (“Gender and Industry in *Herland*”
101). 

The ambient paradigm of production frees Herlanders from commodity production
and the exploitative traps inherent therein. The way this reduction of
unnecessary labor comes about becomes especially clear when framed by the
theory of value in Karl Marx’s *Capital*, published slightly fewer than fifty
years before *Herland*. In the labor theory of value, the exchange value of a
commodity is defined by the cost necessary to reproduce the means of
production---which includes the sustenance of the laborers---plus the surplus
value, which derives from the unpaid labor that occurs after the laborers have
done enough to provide for their physical necessities.[^ln-8-9-capital]
When the only thing produced is a communally held environment, though, the
workers’ aggregate labor does nothing more than reproduce the means of
production. This is more than to say that they only work as long as is
necessary for their own sustenance; rather, they create a situation that gives
them what they need without the necessity of labor beyond a constantly
diminishing minimum. Labor is required to create that situation, but the goal
of labor is always the reduction of further labor rather than the increase of
profitability. Past this point, the entire economy---which here, in the absence
of a market, consists only of the production of use value[^ln-use-value]---is subsumed
by the ecology, with the exception of minor ecological interventions like
Ellador’s encounter with the obernut. 

[^ln-8-9-capital]: See chapters eight and nine and the first section of chapter
ten of *Capital* volume one (133-151).

[^ln-use-value]: On use value and labor, see John Bellamy Foster: “Marx
[wrote] in his *Economic Manuscript of 1861-63* that ‘actual labour is the
appropriation of nature for the satisfaction of human needs….’ It followed that
the actual activity of labor was never independent of nature’s own
wealth-creating potential, ‘since material wealth, the world of use values,
exclusively consists of natural materials modified by labour’” (157). To the
extent that labor does exist in Herland, it appears to take this form
exclusively, except that the modification takes as its product ecological
systems rather than commodities.

With both production and consumption becoming incorporated into part of the
larger environment, the processes enter a different sort of relationship with
each other than the one that characterizes, for example, supply and demand. The
relationship that results comes into particular focus in the context of
Gilman's other attempts to address this problem, albeit by different menas.
Walter Benn Michaels, in his reading of “The Yellow Wallpaper,” describes a
system that is in many ways a market version of the Herland garden economy;
many of the problems he points out are resolved in *Herland* by the removal of
the market from Herland entirely. Michaels argues that in “The Yellow
Wallpaper,” published in 1892, the woman’s body becomes a site “simultaneously
of production and consumption…rewritten as the utopian body of the market
economy” in which “products not only exist to be consumed, but coming into
existence they already are consumed.” The simultaneous buying and selling,
producing and consuming of the self is conditional to *owning* that self,
making “exchange…the condition of [one’s] existence.” This “triumphant
omnipresence of market relations” is, for Michaels, the cause of the
character’s nervous breakdown: the narrator’s “marking” the yellow wallpaper
that is the object of her constant, compulsive meditation and simultaneously
being “marked” by it in turn both indicates the logic of the market economy and
is the main feature of the narrator’s madness (*The Gold Standard* 13). The
system depicted in *Herland* shares this simultaneity and omnipresence of
production and consumption---but it exists without market relations and without
breakdown. Framing the built environment with the managed natural environment
turns the conditions of a collapse into the conditions of an ideal society,
replacing market forces with ecological balance. Money, exchange, and the
marketplace are entirely absent from the narrative: unlike almost every other
conspicuous absence, each of which is foregrounded by discussion between the
outsiders and Herlanders, money never comes up in Herland.[^ln-money] Without a
market economy in which the product is always “already consumed,” goods are
always already produced *and* consumed: consumption exists in complex
interrelation with production as part of the ecology. 

[^ln-money]: Prior to their foray money is mentioned indirectly, but only as a
feature of the world beyond Herland: Terry’s family wealth bankrolls the
expedition and provides the biplane (33).

The reproduction of one’s own labor through self-sustenance, as the means by
which this simultaneous production and consumption occurs, is sufficient
contribution to the Herland ecology---and as such, it is a Herlander’s only
economic obligation. Ecology is a mutuality of being, an involuntary
interrelation of organisms that requires of them only that they survive:
therefore, when ecology replaces market relations, living is the only “socially
necessary” labor. With *Herland*, Gilman uses the production of environment,
which occurs almost entirely as a concomitant of living, to envision an
assimilation of the vital processes into the ecology-driven economy; this frees
the vital processes from the reliance on an external economy that Michaels
describes, stabilizing it against disruption from without. Environmental
production provides Herlanders with freedom from market exploitation and makes
the welfare of the individual subject essential to the health of the system
that contains it.

### Domestic versus Ambient Labor

To produce only environment and to live instead of work: these concepts in many
ways sound like the kind of domesticity that Gilman abhorred and spent
much of her career attempting to reform. The terms of her ecological economy
even borrow from and contribute to the terms of domesticity at the turn of the
twentieth century. But it is not in acquiescence to domesticity that she
engages it: rather, it is precisely this reappropriation of housework
into the sphere of the economy that defines Gilman’s rejoinder to existing
domesticity. To be understood, Gilman’s economic paradigm of
environmental production has finally to be considered alongside her lifelong
pursuit of domestic reform.

Throughout Gilman’s career, she sharply criticized the relegation of women to
the domestic sphere and the exploitation inherent in domestic
labor;[^ln-gilman-on-domestic-labor] among the most programmatic of the results
was her part in the campaign for the kitchenless household. In *Women and
Economics*, she argues that “change in the economic position of woman from
dependence to independence must bring with it a rearrangement of these home
interests and industries” (224). Thus, she lays out a vision of
“apartments…without kitchens” except those “belonging to the house from which
meals could be served to the families in their rooms or in a common
dining-room,” hoping thereby to liberate the “hundreds of thousands of women in
New York City alone who are wage-earners, and who also have families”
(242-3).[^ln-domestic-labor-refs] In a strikingly similar passage in *Herland*,
Van says, “For food we either went to any convenient eating-house, ordered a
meal brought in, or took it with us to the woods, always and equally good”
(144). The relevance of this domestic reform advocacy to the utopian vision of
Herland is unsurprising, but what *Herland* adds to the conversation is a
consideration of these communal spaces as part of the larger, self-sustaining
system. The communal kitchens are what nourish and revitalize the soil that in
turn produces the material that those kitchens and their dependents need to
survive. The stated goal of Gilman’s domestic reform---of incorporating
domestic labor into the sphere of the economy by opening it to division of
labor[^ln-division-labor-refs]---becomes in *Herland* an
incorporation of domestic labor into ecological management. In this ecological
garden economy, environmental production *is* that economized version of
domesticity.

[^ln-gilman-on-domestic-labor]: See especially *Women and Economics*, *The
Home: Its Work and Influence*, and “The Waste of Private Housekeeping.” For the
wider context of domestic reform in Gilman’s work and in the context of the
early twentieth century, see Yvonne Gaudelieus’s “Kitchenless Houses and Homes:
Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Reform of Architectural Space,” Polly Wynn
Allen’s *Building Domestic Liberty*, and Dolores Hayden’s “Two Utopian
Feministsand Their Campaigns for Kitchenless Houses.”

[^ln-domestic-labor-refs]: See also Allen’s *Building Domestic Liberty*: “By
the middle of the nineteenth century, roughly one-third of American women
entered the paid labor force on a temporary basis, usually until they married.
Only the poorest women---immigrants, widows, and free blacks---engaged in a
lifelong effort to make ends meet financially by working outside of their
homes” (12).

[^ln-division-labor-refs]: See Chang, especially 323-4; and Fusco 420-1.

Indeed, since the closed ecological system that defines Herland eliminates the
distinction between interior and exterior space, the garden model of society
delineates a vision of a productive home, the spatial equivalent of
living-as-labor. The complicated lines of home and world are born out by a
conversation between Terry, the mouthpiece of domestic imprisonment, and Jeff,
the character who eventually becomes a male Herlander and appears to speak the
Herland party line: 

> “*Home!*” [Terry] sneered. “There isn’t a home in the whole pitiful place.”

> “There isn’t anything else, and you know it,” Jeff retorted hotly. (121)

In Jeff’s explanation, “home” means so much that it has, to Terry, effectively
become meaningless. Home is defined in contradistinction to economic labor by
the masculinist Terry, and the conversation can be taken as Gilman’s narrative
staging of the housework-as-labor question. If foresting is both the base of
the Herland economy and part of making dinner, can it be called housework? If
the kitchen and pantry circumscribe the world, is everything housework? The
rhetorical question that Gilman repeatedly included in lectures to women’s
clubs becomes paramount: “Shall the home be our world? or the world our home?”
(qtd. in Allen 18). The means of eliminating this distinction in *Herland*, in
the context of what has been shown above, is its inclusion in a system larger
than itself. The imprisonment implicit in the first of Gilman’s options---“the
home be[ing] our world”---is based on the exclusion of that space from the
systems beyond it. But taking the “world [as] our home” implies the application
of a domestic paradigm of labor to a larger system.[^ln-expanding-domestic] The
blending of interior and exterior space also requires the interrelation of the
systems that define both. The exterior struggle of *nomia* and *logia*, of
mastery and the non-participation implied in study, is resolved by a paradigm
of productive domesticity only if the walls of the home are allowed to
encompass the world, thereby bringing that world under the sway of its laws.
Put another way, *Herland*’s garden system can be seen as a way of making
economy, ecology, and domesticity resolve each other.

[^ln-expanding-domestic]: It is in this sense, as Jennifer Fleissner argues,
that the expanded home of *Herland* offers a kind of solution to the
“naturalist” domesticity-as-degeneration of “The Yellow Wallpaper,” and the
garden of *Herland* fixes the image of the gated garden of the earlier short
story’s setting (Fleissner 87, 95). The impossible labor of ordering that leads
to the “Wallpaper” narrator’s breakdown, she points out, becomes an effective
ordering of the *Herland* garden. This shift to effectiveness can be seen, I am
suggesting, as a product of domestic labor’s inclusion in the at once
ecological and economic system.

### Coevolution and the Metabolic Rift 

What, then, is the place of the human in the environment in *Herland*---that of
the producer or the product? And how does this view of the garden come to bear
on the vision of evolution presented in *Herland* and elsewhere in Gilman’s
writing? In beginning to answer these questions---and in her occasionally
essayistic prose, she does so with an unusual directness---Gilman reveals her
complicated relationship to evolutionary theory and the environmental factors
that influence it. She replicates her own ambivalence with respect to some of
the major evolutionary arguments of the nineteenth century in an exchange
between Terry and the Herlander Zava: when Terry refers to August Weissmann’s
refutation[^ln-ramsbeck] of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, saying that “acquired traits
are not transmittable,” Zava and Terry respond:

>“If that is so, then our improvement must be due either to mutation, or solely
to education,” she gravely pursued. “We certainly have improved. It may be that
all these higher qualities were latent in the original mother; that careful
education is bringing them out; and that our personal differences depend on
slight variations in prenatal condition.”

>“I think it is more in your accumulated culture,” Jeff suggested. “And in the
amazing psychic growth you have made.” (103)

At stake here are the comparative roles of genetics and culture to evolutionary
development. The first sentence can be seen as weighing Darwinism against
Lamarckism, but no clear conclusion is reached. Zava also presents another
possibility, however, a unique synthesis of biological and environmental
determinism in which everyone descended from the original mother---which to
Herlanders means the known world---contains dormant unrealized powers that only
careful nurture can bring out. In this possibility, prenatal *conditions*
rather than genetic makeup determine the distinctions between individuals. This
view places emphasis on communal self-improvement in tandem with the inherent
worth of the individual. Put another way, it simultaneously posits an essential
and predetermined character and a gradual development of that character, a
course limited by both genetic makeup and environment while being guaranteed by
neither. A final element is added to the discussion by Jeff’s suggestion, which
favors a “culture” and communal “psychic growth” that are, it later becomes
clear, instilled by the system of education.  This discussion reveals a complex
interrelation of three elements in Gilman’s version of evolution: genetic
inheritance, environmental influence, and education. Here and throughout the
novel, none of these elements becomes central enough to be seen as a
mechanistic determinant; the exploration of each must necessarily take place in
terms of its interaction with the others.

[^ln-ramsbeck]: See Beth Sutton-Ramsbeck’s note on on the passage in *Herland
and Related Writings* (103 note 1).

Gilman’s take on the first element, the genetic side of guided evolution, is
the one that has been the most (and most polemically) discussed in Gilman
scholarship. As is evident in the idea of an “original mother” from whom the
Herlanders have inherited their “higher qualities,” this genetic concept of
evolution, when taken in the context of the garden’s managed development, leads
quickly to a problematic relationship to eugenics. These implications would be
hashed out by Gilman herself fifteen years after *Herland*, in an unpublished
(perhaps unpublishable) article called “Gardening and the Baser Passions.”
Though evidently an attempt to be humorous---or so it is described in a letter
from Charlotte Barbour, one of Gilman’s editors at Putnam, explaining that the
essay would not be accepted by horticulture journals (Barbour)---in such a grim
context the effect is anything but. In sharp contrast to a sentimental view of
the garden parodied early in the article, Gilman says that the main work of the
gardener is not to plow, plant, or harvest---rather, “his main business, his
longdrawn incessant effort, is to kill.” From this premise the rest of the
essay describes the many and various ways to kill as well as the necessity to
“kill without ceasing” if the gardener’s “plants are to live,” and finally
dissolving into a litany of the many organisms detrimental to the gardener’s
efforts. Although, as Cynthia J.  Davis points out, it would be incorrect to
suggest that none of the reprehensible and often racist views that defined her
conservative old age had developed when she was writing *Herland*, it seems
that not until “her later years” did “Gilman [become] a decided proponent of
eugenics” in the way she is if her essay on gardening is to be taken as
extending to the garden of her society (“His and Herland” 82). Indeed, a shift
in the way she considers the *literal* garden is documented in her
correspondence well after the time of *Herland*. In a letter to Alice Park on
June 29th, 1928, some two years before the rejection of the “Gardening” essay
and thirteen years after *Herland*, Gilman writes: 

> All May the planning and planting, all June the weed-weed-Weeding. I’ve changed
my mind about the word “fighting” as applied to weed. If the desire to kill and
desperate efforts thereto, against the ceaseless pressure of an en-enemy
[*sic*], a million-headed enemy which rises up like Anteus is not a fight, what
is it? (*Selected Letters* 272)

Her acceptance of the violent paradigm for the gardener in 1928 indicates that
her position prior to that point was a gentler (if willfully myopic) view of
managed growth---perhaps best defined by a metaphor of “planting” rather than
“weeding.” Though by no means a resolution to the novel’s eugenics problem (it
merely shifts to a different type of eugenics), this emphasis on traits that
are encouraged over those that are discouraged allows Gilman to avoid the overt
brutality that she would later embrace regarding literal gardening.
Accordingly, the role of the human as simultaneous producer and product of the
environment is more complicated as it appears in *Herland* than this later
depiction of the gardener’s task.

[^ln-eugenics-criticism]: The topic of eugenics, along with the question of
race in Gilman more generally, has been a major and controversial topic of
Gilman scholarship. The initiating essay in this strand of criticism is Susan
S. Lanser’s 1989 essay “Feminist Criticism, ‘The Yellow Wallpaper,’ and the
Politics of Color in America,” which Jennifer L. Fleissner says has since
become “hegemonic” (Fleissner 95). Cynthia J. Davis provides a rigorous
historical and biographical context to eugenics in *Herland* in her essay on
Gilman and Lester F. Ward, “His and Herland.” In a somewhat different vein,
Fleissner urges a re-historicization of the eugenic conversation in terms of
middle-class women, nineteenth-century feminism, and the rise of a “therapeutic
culture” as it relates to race in America (92-5).

The model of evolutionary guidance that Gilman emphasizes in her novel is
instead focused on the *environmental* management described above, the second
determinant in her tripartite system of evolution. The effects of this process
thus extend beyond the purely social change of the various domestic reform
movements and into the biological realm, and guidance of human development
occurs at one level of remove. Here the vision of an enriched soil becomes the
operative metaphor, above either “planting” or “weeding,” in that the
environment that encourages and guides growth is the only thing directly
interfered with---*not* the organism itself. This view of the environment’s
relationship to biological development comes largely from the influence of
Lester F. Ward, a contemporary of Gilman’s who was a botanist, paleontologist,
and sociologist, and whom she considered one of the most important thinkers of
her time. This approval was due in large part to of his gynaecocentric view of
evolution, which afforded a primacy to women very much in line with Gilman’s
own thinking. Cynthia J. Davis has conclusively demonstrated the influence of
Ward on Gilman’s writing in general and *Herland* in particular, even arguing
that the novel can be seen as a narrative extension Ward’s theories
and an extension of his gynaecocentric theory. Most important in terms of
Gilman’s relationship to environment is Ward’s Lamarckian view of evolution:
because Lamarck proposed the inheritance of acquired traits across generations,
environmental influence becomes central to that process to the extent that it
determines which traits an organism acquires.[^ln-lamarck-giraffe] As Davis points out,
Gilman goes even further than Ward (and Lamarck) with her emphasis on the role
of environment in human evolution: environment is Gilman’s “answer” to “why
women had not flourished,” Davis says, and the limits imposed by environmental
factors are “crucial to Gilman’s brand of determinism” (“His and Herland” 76).
It is in considering the relationship of biological and environmental
determinism that one major effect of parthenogenetic reproduction in *Herland*
becomes clear: it sets to one side biological differentiation by
reproductive selection, as if she is isolating the variable of environment to
better argue for its effect on evolutionary development. Purely biological
determinism is ruled out as an explanation for evolution except to the extent
that biological difference is itself determined by environment.

[^ln-lamarck-giraffe]: The famous example of the giraffe stretching its neck
for food is particularly illustrative of this point: according to Lamarck, the
giraffe’s neck is long because of generations of stretching to find the best
leaves (Lamarck 122).

The unique relationship of human and environment that appears in *Herland* is
brought into focus by a contemporaneous article that Gilman published in
*Circle Magazine* in 1908, entitled “Modern Beatitudes---The Newness of the
Earth.” Here she suggests that the earth and the human species are both mere
children, as yet relatively undeveloped but constantly growing into balance
with one another. The evolution of the human race is framed here as a gradual
accretion of understanding as to the effects of human activity on the
earth---or an understanding of what has since scaled up to become the
anthropocene---coupled with a mass-adaptation based on that understanding.
After describing the gradual exhaustion of the earth’s resources by “our
present methods,” Gilman reassures us that the process will not continue to its
catastrophic conclusion, for we 

> are waking up in good earnest these days; ceasing to be a baby race, a set of
ignorant, selfish, short-sighted infants, madly quarreling with one another
over the fruits most easily gathered. We are young yet, but no longer mere
children; young with the splendid hope and courage of youth, but not with the
weakness and irresponsibility of infancy.…All we have to do is to apply
ourselves to study the conditions of life on earth, and learn to meet them.

Humanity is saved, in this account, by its inevitable development into a wiser,
gentler race. Progress in this vision is not social Darwinist Herbert Spencer’s steady march
from simplicity to complexity or the continued expansion of the race to the
edges of the earth. It is instead a renunciation of wastefulness and
destructive behavior, which is to be replaced by the more careful management of
the natural environment. “There is absolutely nothing prevent us,” she
continues in clear anticipation of *Herland*, “from reforesting our
hills, checking our floods, preserving our soils, maintaining the balance of
nature plus the art and skill and learning of mankind.” The paradigm of the
human struggling against the natural world is replaced by the simultaneous
development of both realms. By framing this development in terms of the growth
of the race, she implies a vision of *coevolution* defined by an increase in
balance, not an opposition to be resolved by conflict: refinement replaces
dominance and expansion. Development without growth has been the key to
Herland's continued existence; it predates *Herland* in Gilman's thinking as a
concept for the entire planet.

This system of non-competitive coevolution is at the foundation of Gilman’s
garden society, but can be seen as part of a much larger sociological and scientific
trajectory beginning in the nineteenth century. Though she was not influenced
by Marx---she was vocal about her distaste for Marx and Marxism, perhaps not
least because of the depiction of women in his work[^ln-gilman-marxism]---his concept of the “metabolism” between humanity and
nature nevertheless bears strong resemblance to the coevolutionary paradigm in
*Herland*. Marx’s social metabolism (*Stoffwechsel*) is at the center of John
Bellamy Foster’s book *Marx’s Ecology*, in which he demonstrates the influence
of a materialist conception of the natural world on Marx’s thinking, and rebuts
claims that Marx is an anti-ecological proponent of industrial development at
the expense of the natural world. The metabolism of human and nature
constitutes a set of “evolving material relations” in which the human’s
simultaneous dependence on and alteration of its environment determine the
circular, material exchange between them (Foster 11, 155-60). Labor becomes, in
Marx’s view, 

> a process between man and nature…by which man, through his own actions,
mediates, regulates and controls the metabolism between himself and
nature.…Through this movement [of the laboring body] he acts upon external
nature and changes it, and in this way he simultaneously changes his own
nature. (qtd. in Foster 157)

For labor to be an effective mediation of the system, though, it must be
“actual labor,” which produces only the material wealth of use-values (157). In
other words, it has to be a system like Herland’s that eschews the market
entirely. The material interchange that defines this concept derives in large
part from the rise of “energetics” in the physical sciences in the 1840s and
1850s, leading to a particular emphasis in Marx’s metabolic system on the
possible enrichment and degradation of soil found in the work of James Anderson
and Justus von Liebig (Foster 144-9, 161). Because the metabolism depends on
the energetics of soil, the separation of town and country causes a “rift” that
leads to the gradual despoliation of the environment (141-5). Unregulated
production and disharmony between the built and natural environments, two of
the concepts most heavily revised in Gilman’s system of coevolution, are the
factors that Marx identifies as disruptors of the metabolism. 

[ln-gilman-marxism]: See for example Denise D. Knight’s biography of Gilman:
“With other socialists of her background and inclinations, Charlotte distrusted
Marx and preferred to rely on the intellectual labors of a native-born
intelligentsia that included herself.…For the most part, she sought her desired
economic transformations within the capitalist system even while criticizing
that system for its intrinsically patriarchal attitudes and practices” (197).
Gilman herself provides additional detail in her autobiography, *The Living of
Charlotte Perkins Gilman*, saying, “My socialism was of the early humanitarian
kind, based on the first exponents, French and English, with the American
enthusiasm of Bellamy. The narrow and rigid ‘economic determinism’ of Marx,
with its ‘class consciousness’ and ‘class struggle’ I never accepted, nor the
political methods pursued by Marxians” (131). Although Gilman’s own distaste
for Marxism has kept it out of much Gilman scholarship, the similarity of the
concept of the “metabolism” discussed below is extremely useful comparatively,
both in bringing out the specifics and implications of Gilman’s own ecology and
placing her in the larger intellectual context of her time (even the parts of
that context that she herself might not place herself in).

Considering this metabolic system in relation to *Herland*, we see the
relationship of Gilman’s evolutionary system to the garden environment and the
consequent system of labor, and specifically the way world-building and
community-building are related dialectically through labor. Environmental
management, achieved through a reversion to the “actual labor” that produces
only use-value, is a means of guiding the complex material interchange
essential to the coevolution of the Herlanders and Herland. In order to effect
meaningful change on this front, the Herlanders have to change their own
practices and culture, which they do in part by altering their material
environment. 

But the determining factors in this relationship with environment are not
exclusively physical. The physical is mediated by the cultural, and the
cultural place of environment is, as one might suspect, just as rigorously and
systemically guided as the material ecology.  Education forms the final piece
of Gilman's coevolutionary system and is the means by which it is developed and
maintain across generations, allowing individual social and cultural
adaptations to environment to accrue over time.[^ln-simone] The Herlanders
model and reinforce the dialectic with environment through a ludic system of
education that is just as "ambient" as their system of labor. When asked about
Herland schools, the Herlander Somel says, “With the babies…we first provide an
environment which feeds the mind without tiring it…. But as early as
possible…we provide choices, simple choices, with very obvious causes and
consequences” (128). The system of education graduates from an accretion of
environmental understanding to the gradual realization that human action
affects that environment, just as Gilman describes in “Modern Beatitudes.” 

[^ln-simone]: For a broader view of gilman’s interest in education reform, see
Deborah M. De Simone’s “Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Educational Reform.”

Moreover, the second stage of education is achieved through *games* that
“develop the faculties [they] wish to encourage.” Games are shown to be
foundations of pedagogy---and, thus, social determinants---in the incident near
the beginning of the novel in which the men’s escape attempt is interrupted by
an invitation to play. Three Herlanders set up a pile of stones with a yellow
nut on top, and invite the men to throw stones at the pile. They fail miserably
until “Jeff succeed[s] in bringing the whole structure to the ground. It took
me [Van] still longer, and Terry, to his intense annoyance, came third.”
Experience of the pedagogic built environment is followed by swift instruction
and the presentation of an alternative method:

> Then Celis set up the little tripod again, and looked back at us, knocking it
down, pointing at it, and shaking her short curls severely. “No,” [Celis] said.
“Bad---wrong!”…Then she set it up once more, put the fat nut on top, and
returned to the others; and there those aggravating girls sat and took turns
throwing little stones at that thing, while one stayed by as a setter-up; and
they just popped that nut off, two times out of three, without upsetting the
sticks. (69)

The contrast between the two performances is severalfold. The men’s idea of
victory, for which they are reprimanded, destroys the entire tower; the women
strike only what they mean to, with minimal disruption to the larger structure.
The men compete against each other and against the women, sulking when they
lose and becoming divided; the women cooperate for the most efficient group
performance, systematizing the resetting of the structure and taking turns, and
their performance is described not according to the relative success of the
members but according to their aggregate success rate. The difference between
the two types of competition is the difference between boxing and a boat race:
success of the individual in the men’s group leads to the failure of the rest
of the group, while the success of a single Herlander contributes to communal
benefit. In both the relationship to the external and the interrelationship of
the internal, the competitive tendencies of the men---which destroy the
external elements of the system and waste time and energy---are contrasted with
the precise and cooperative systems of the women, which culminate in a system
of cyclical and effortless play. This basic structure describes the Herland
school system, which becomes at the higher levels a system of ecological
instruction. (Recall the “forester” passage discussed in the introduction:
Ellador’s interactions with insects are guided by a “bug teacher,” and this
guidance leads her to forestry.) Education in Herland discourages tendencies
like competition, which disrupt the managed ecology of the garden, while it
reinforces the gardener’s mentality of cyclical action and cooperative
development. Social evolution brings the development of society into line with
the development of the environment, managing the material interchange of human
and nature.

Coevolution is the foundation of Gilman’s garden---a “vegetable garden mind
you!, not merely flowers”: it allows identity of sustenance with the sustained,
simultaneity of the built and the natural, and cyclical reproduction in tandem
with evolutionary progress. The three elements of Gilman’s evolutionary
paradigm (genetics, environment, and education) work in a mutually reinforcing
system. Education instills the values of an environmental management in which
the self is included, guiding the creation and maintenance of an environment
that Gilman believes is the determinant of genetic variation and physical
transmutation. The principles of the sustaining garden finally bring social and
physical evolution into harmony. 

The question remains of how to approach a system of evolution that is marred
from one side by ethical problems and from the other by retrospective
scientific inaccuracy. To begin on an ethical (and negative) level, this
tripartite system does not enable us to dismiss the problematics of race and
eugenics in *Herland*, but they may complicate the understanding of the system
in the same way that understanding Gilman’s reliance of Lester F. Ward does;
recognizing such connections allows us to better place Gilman in an
historicizing context, even if it does not (and should not) allow us to hold
her system up as an exact roadmap.

This speculative evolutionary system does come into useful focus, however, when
we consider it in terms of the utopian function of the novel. If we
provisionally take utopian fiction as a speculative fulfillment of problems
deriving from the author's historical present---a process sympathetic to
Frederic Jameson’s concept of aesthetic resolutions to real problems, though
perhaps not identical with it[^ln-jameson]---the usefulness of Gilman’s
evolutionary narrative becomes more conceivable. The next section will bring
the issues of labor and evolution discussed above to bear on *Herland*’s
ecotopian function, asking how its utopian response to the common tropes of
American literary naturalism can bring it into greater contact with the
concerns of the Environmental Humanities.

Unconscious*.

### Utopian Naturalism and the Environmental Humanities

[Need to incorporate more of the old conclusion (at the end of this draft) to
better incorporate some intro regarding how to reconcile this with the literary
critical reception]

That may well cover much of what can be taken from *Herland* in a purely
environmental sense; but the novel also occupies a unique space in literary
historical terms, in a disputed space between realism and naturalism. This
literary context exists in codependence with the environmental paradigms Gilman
establishes with her garden economy. As such, the utopian version of naturalism
that her work constitutes has unique implications on the larger impact of her
work in an evironmentalist sense.

An influential recent reading of Herland as a naturalist novel has come in
Jennifer Fleissner's *Women, Compulsion, Modernity*. Fleissner takes up the
garden theme in slightly different terms than those employed here, arguing that
x,y, and z. As compelling as this re-categorization of *Herland* certainly is,
its focus in some ways leaves out the materialist implications to which Gilman
applies some fundamental naturalist premises of mean her utopian schema. Among
the few tenets of American literary naturalism agreed upon in the criticism (a
house somewhat divided to say the least) are a handful of premises recognizable
in *Herland*'s major threads of argument: a; b; and c [source from below and
footnote sources]. In Gilman's treatment, all of these come together in a
single, broad conception of environmental determinism. As I have shown, a
belief in environmental determinism is the basis of the systems in Gilman's
novel, each of which rests on the logical anteriority of external conditions to
individual and communal nature. Broadly, Gilman is arguing by example that by
changing those external conditions, the course of society and the species can
be somehow governed.

Where this differs from orthodox literary naturalism (if such a thing exists)
is in its unabashed belief in the power of human influence over these
conditions. In other naturalist novels, that determinism is very much a one-way
street. In *The House of Mirth*, *The Pit*, and *The Financier*, widespread
capitalist excess induces the paradigmatic "plot of decline" in the individual
characters through gambling and speculation, which in the eyes of these
novelists amount to the same thing. Elsewhere, malignant social influences lead
to the moral disintegration of the naturalist protagonist, but somehow that
protagonist never gets a word in edgewise. The conditions that, to the
naturalist, *create people* are not open to revision; they only revise.
Suggesting that it can be otherwise is the basis of Gilman's utopianism---and,
some might say, the naivete the epithet implies. 

But then, the difference between what I am calling "utopian naturalism" and
traditional naturalism may merely be a matter greater optimism with respect to
collective action. What ultimately prevents deliberate influence over external
conditions in the other naturalist novels I brought up above is *failed*
collective action, which hangs over many specimens of the genre like a spectre.
In *The Octopus*, stilted collective movements take on the status almost of an
obsession for Norris: time and again he creates moments in which things might
change forever, the masses might be stirred into world-historical action, if
only the right word is said in the right manner---and time and again, that
moment is missed or is deliberately thwarted.[^norris-collective-examples] In
*Sister Carrie*, too, wage riots that might conceivably have revised the plight
of someone like Hurstwood silently crumble in the background of the main plot,
mere set-pieces laden with the possibility of an alternate
history.[^dreiser-collective-examples] In *Herland*, successful collective
action is assumed, but it is collective action in the absence of the
overwhelming force of a total system of capitalism. Only the women remain after
the disasters that sequester Herland from the rest of the world, and those
women respond to necessity apparently with one mind and with one possible
solution to the scarcity problem. What is utopian about the novel, then, is
perhaps not the promise of what collective action could achieve, but the ease
of achieving it in the first place and its totality once
realized.[^bellamy-collective-action] 

Precisely that ease and totality should be a source of pause for anyone
evaluating *Herland* as a case study, for a double ominous silence pervades the
novel in its failure to address questions: Where is the state? and Where is the
room for dissensus? The voices of those Herlanders not permitted to reproduce
(or forced to reproduce) by the will of the majority should remind us of
everything that is subtly horrifying in the novel, and serve as a reminder that
it is to be approached with some caution and skepticism. The whole task of
guiding human development puts an enormous weight on the question of how such
decisions are made equitably, and it is precisely this issue to which Gilman
devotes the least attention.

Nevertheless, Gilman's utopian naturalism---with all the mutual determination
of the individual with social, economic, and ecological systems that it
implies---is what makes her version of the garden society distinct from other
images of the "garden" more familiar to the American literary canon. Its
material-cultural continuum that posits environmental praxis as a fundamental
aspect of political praxis. Indeed, in the utopian naturalist system,
environmental praxis is logically anterior to any meaningful political change,
because it understands environment as an absolute determinant of political and
cultural structures, even if that determination is mutual. 

*Herland*'s understanding that human and natural systems are inseparable leads
her to the structures I have exposed here, and the resulting system both
predicts what we now call social ecology and repurposes the determinism assumed
by American literary naturalism. Where Gilman exceeds Leo Marx's other
examples, then, is in its insistence on communal, material praxis as a means of
transcending natural and economic limitations. But it also differs from other
gardens in its understanding of the human as just one more element that makes
up the garden system. 

### Conclusion: Transition Narratives and the Steady-State System (?)

When it is viewed as an environmentalist text, more can be taken from *Herland*
than a snapshot of a once-progressive system of thought. The novel can be
considered as part of a literary canon of transition from a status quo based on
growth, capitalism, and ecological destruction to a future based on
steady-state development and a truly ecological society. *Herland* can be
considered a narrative of transition because of its obvious resonances with
localism and the sustainable forestry its conditions of scarcity require. But
in addition, Herland's own foundational myth is one of transition from a
civilization embedded in a larger ecosystem and political network to one that
is materially independent.[^ln-herlands-transition] In this context, the
miracle of parthenogenesis becomes a larger symbol of autochthony and
self-regeneration in terms that go well beyond the human.

[^ln-herlands-transition]: Find the passages about Herland's foundation myth.

"Transition" is a term that has gained global prominence in the past decades
with the rise of the "transition network," a loose organization of communities
committed to becoming less dependent on global flows of energy in general and
fossil fuel economies in particular.[^ln-rob-hopkins] The role of aesthetics
and narrative in this process of transition has so far been focused on our
relationships to energy systems: in *Living Oil* (2014), for example, Stephanie
LeMenager reads "physical infrastructure against artistic forms" to "explore
how social affects might be shifted toward a different-looking and -feeling
post-petroleum future" (68). She discusses the movement primarily in terms of
its relevance to "peak oilers," anti-oil activists who use narratives of
transition to imagine not just the end of oil, but what is on the other side of
it---imagined infrastructures and energy systems along with replacements for
the affective connections with aspects of our culture that LeMenager argues are
inseparable from our energy infrastructure (66-8).[^lemenager-transitions] A
literary canon of transition cannot stop with energy systems, though. More
fundamental contradictions exist between human systems and the ecologies that
contain them, and literatures of economic and cultural transition will also
demand to be read.

[^ln-rob-hopkins]: a few notes on rob hopkins, transition network, some sources

A vision like Gilman's, however utopian, could be very instructive indeed in
the context of this emergent literature of transition to a post-fossil-fuel
economy and the recent eruption into the mainstream of "cli-fi."[^clifi] Of
course, *Herland* is far from perfect and even further from a roadmap. Even if
we ignore the magical premise, we have to content with the Malthusian
population control, "refinement" through eugenics, and the impossibility of
dissensus. That is to say that we see some of the same grave challenges that
have plagued other precursors to and early forms of environmentalism. But
pursuing a literary canon of transition will mean taking literature as a
staging ground for those challenges, not as a magic mirror that only shows a
perfect world---even when a utopian novel may think it is providing just that.
*Herland* can be a fulcrum for putting pressure on an ideology of localism
that, as Paul Gilroy complained in reference to Raymond Williams, is not
sufficiently separated from racist nationalisms. In working through *Herland*,
we have to ask how to disentangle the material necessity of localism from the
cultural necessity of cultural inclusiveness.

Reading a novel as a novel of transition also implies a certain *method* of
reading with elements of surface reading rooted in a context of materialism.
Like LeMenager's task of reading "physical infrastructure against artistic
forms," I propose to take seriously the spatial organization and material
interventions in the ecology and infrastructure that are elaborated in the
interstices of *Herland*'s loose narrative. These details can reveal both the
conceptual place of Gilman's particular ecotopian imagination in American
environmental thought and the moments where she exceeds or adds to that
thinking.

<br>

In this expanded environmental of Gilman’s utopian novel, we can see her
speculative society as a garden-based model of transition. She represents a
submerged counternarrative of the garden image in American literature: one that
has less to do with the Edenic, expansionist visions of her contemporaries than
with the more sophisticated and politically astute gardens of the past fifty
years. As a figure of American literature, she offers a way of opposing the
simplistic determinism and social Darwinism so often attributed to naturalist
fiction, all the while marshaling an altered version of these concepts to
delineate a non-exploitative system of labor that resists, even counteracts,
the despoliation of the environment. To write with some reference to literary
naturalism, a genre uniquely concerned with reflecting reality, is for Gilman a
way of addressing the reality that actually is---just as the utopian function
of her brand of naturalism is a way of creating the reality that should be.
Additionally, the concept of the garden puts Gilman in context as an early if
unorthodox figure in American environmentalism on top of her stable if
controversial position in the history of American feminism. Certainly all
accounts of her work have had to grapple with such multiple axes of
consideration: the socialist, the feminist, the environmentalist, the utopian
thinker. Just as the plants in a well-planned garden, the conversations that
inhere in *Herland* exist in complex interrelation, each offsetting and
nurturing the others, together forming a multifarious and complicated whole.

###Note: This is the old conclusion; parts of it will become footnotes and/or incorporated into an introduction to the "Utopian naturalism" section.

The literary context and thematic content of *Herland* invite a reading of it
in terms of American literary naturalism, and indeed Gilman features as an
occasional figure in (especially contemporary) criticism on naturalism. The
difficulty of considering the novel in these terms, however, comes from the
notoriously vexed term “naturalism” itself. The only obvious consensus in
contemporary criticism of the movement is a rejection of a straw-man
descriptions of it in which individual agency is seen as always subjugated to
an uncomplicated determinism. Beyond this, any foray into naturalism seems to
come with either a radical reworking of the category or, as in the case of
Walter Benn Michaels in *The Gold Standard and the Logic of Literary
Naturalism*, an explicit desire to “avoid that debate entirely” (26). But the
stable threads that emerge as topics of conversation (if not arguments within
those topics) are distinct enough to admit the category as evidence and
consider the ways that Gilman is wading into these intellectual and artistic
streams. The most commented-upon of these topics is the relationship of
individual agency to deterministic forces, which the most compelling
discussions take as occasions in which naturalist novelists complicate the
rendering of the agentive self, not as the means by which that self is reduced
or made irrelevant. Lee Clark Mitchell in *Determined Fictions*, for example,
includes in his naturalist canon works that depict the conflict between the
character’s own self-conception as an “autonomous, integrated, freely willing
agent” and the countervailing narrative strategies that prove that conception
to be false; agency becomes largely psychological, while determinism becomes a
narrative, rather than an ontological, premise (xv). Donald Pizer is perhaps
the most optimistic voice on the topic of determinism, seeing in the resistance
to “amoral” deterministic forces a revitalization of “man’s sense of his own
dignity and importance” (11). Jennifer L. Fleissner’s *Women, Compulsion,
Modernity* resolves this tension in part with the concept of *compulsion*, in
which individual agency and “rationalizing ‘forces’ appear as more deeply
intertwined,” nature becomes an important actor in social life, and compulsive
ordering rituals arise as a mediation between the free and determined versions
of the self (9-10). In addition to the determination question, the relevance of
natural law and scientific knowledge to social, political, and economic life is
paramount to most definitions of naturalism, with Mark Seltzer notably arguing
in *Bodies and Machines* that the naturalist novel unites industrial production
with biological reproduction, and that it also responds to the realist premise
of linear narrative continuity by “map[ping] in high relief…the evolutionary
dynamics” of that continuity (43). A third trend of scholarship on naturalism
is to point out the archetypal plot of a character’s “degeneration” into a
figure truly determined by base desires, a trope associated especially with
Frank Norris’s *Vandover the Brute*.^[See for example Seltzer, 36-7.] Each of
these three topics is evident as a theme in *Herland*: a combination of
environmental, biological, and social determinism undergirds her depiction of
coevolutionary praxis; the blending of nature and culture has been discussed at
length above; and the possibility of degeneration into a “brute” dominated by
masculine urges is implicit in the immediate imprisonment of the male intruders
and the defensive stance assumed by the Herlanders.

It is primarily by building on Jennifer Fleissner’s reading of *Herland* in
*Women, Compulsion, Modernity*, however, that my own discussion can come to
bear on the question of literary naturalism. Fleissner’s 2004 intervention into
the study of naturalism has been acknowledged by many reviewers as a major
shift in the terms of the critical conversation, with Hildegard Hoeller,
reviewing the book for *American Literature*, calling it “an altogether new
view of naturalist writing” that leaves our view of the movement “usefully
expanded” (188). By shifting the focus of naturalism to the changing role of
women in the 1890s and the early 20th century, Fleissner reveals the repetitive
motion of compulsion that undergirds, as Rita Felski puts it, “women’s
problematic relationship to historical time” (282). Considering some of the
garden-like aspects of *Herland* in relation to the garden that surrounds the
house of “The Yellow Wallpaper,” which she calls as a “liminal space, neither
home nor wilderness” that “solves the problem of the too-natural ‘outside’ and
the too-cultural ‘inside,’” Fleissner argues that *Herland* should be seen as
“a ‘realist’ response on Gilman’s part to the troubling ‘naturalist’ vision of
the attempt at order manifested in her own earlier story” (95). In this
reading, the obsessional need to order that is so crippling (because its
realization is impossible) in “The Yellow Wallpaper” becomes the foundation of
Gilman’s imagined community, and compulsive domesticity drives “the utopian
social vision that would render the earlier story an obsolete relic” (87-95).
In the context of her larger argument, *Herland* is a feminist alternative to
the literary “West Cure”^[A pun on the “rest cure,” which Gilman was herself
prescribed and which figures in “The Yellow Wallpaper.”] that she takes as a
defining feature of masculine naturalism; in “The Great Indoors” of this
feminine West Cure, domesticity is supposed to perform for women the
therapeutic rehabilitation that young men were alleged to get from “going West”
and contending with the elements, freeing themselves from the teacups and
Victorian parlors of realist fiction (75-98). 

The extent to which domesticity can be taken as a “realist” fix for the
“naturalist” problems of “The Yellow Wallpaper” relies on these definitions of
naturalism and realism.^[For another take on Gilman’s response to naturalism in
her essays from *The Forerunner*, see Christopher P. Wilson’s “Charlotte
Perkins Gilman's Steady Burghers: The Terrain of Herland.”] But the garden of
*Herland* as I have described it here can be seen as an attempt to resolve more
aspects of naturalism^[Such attempts to “resolve” other literary paradigms are
not unprecedented in Gilman’s body of work and its criticism. See Jennifer S.
Tuttle’s “Gilman’s *The Crux* and Owen Wister’s *The Virginian*:
Intertextuality and ‘Woman’s Manifest Destiny’” for another reading of Gilman
responding to masculinist literary production.] than the problems that arise
from the domesticity embodied in the imprisoning leisure garden of “The Yellow
Wallpaper”---though resolving these is certainly much of *Herland*’s project.

The complex interrelation of economy, ecology, domesticity, and evolutionary
theory presents a wider rejoinder, not only to the gated garden of Gilman’s own
earlier “naturalism,” but also to the “rank” and “tangled” vegetation of the
wilderness that stands in for a naturalist view of nature defined by
“Darwinist” competition, non-productivity, and despair. The first things that
Vandyck and the other intruders learn, the condition of their understanding the
Herland garden, is the anti-competitive lesson of the stone-throwing game; the
expansive view of cooperative growth among humans and other organisms, which
defines the economy and ecology of Gilman’s garden, reforms the men who
represent something very external to the circuit between *Herland* and “The
Yellow Wallpaper,” something that extends the argument about domesticity beyond
its initial scope. Widening the focus of Gilman’s response beyond the domestic
in this way requires an addition to the description of *Herland* as “realist”
in Fleissner’s sense. In accepting many of the topics common to the naturalist
novel and revising them with a vision of what happens under certain conditions
of cooperation, Gilman invents a kind of utopian naturalism.^[The term “utopian
naturalism” also allows us to consider *Herland* as a response to naturalism
without losing the rich contextualization of the novel within the utopian
generic tradition. Gilman herself has been very explicit about her interest
especially in Bellamy’s *Looking Backward*, and considering the work in generic
terms is a useful means of approaching the novel. It contextualizes, for
example, the satirical take on the present simultaneous with a programmatic
projection of the future, a feature Frederic Jameson (reading Ernst Bloch)
identifies with Thomas More’s *Utopia* in “Morus: The Generic Window”. The
definitive work on Gilman’s relationship to the idea of utopia and its
corresponding literature is Carol Farley Kessler’s *Charlotte Perkins Gilman:
Her Progress Toward Utopia with Selected Writings*.] This utopian naturalism
accepts many of the premises associated with naturalist writing---some measure
of determinism, the relevance of natural law and scientific theory to social
life, and the need to guard against degeneration---while resolving by way of
the utopian premise those aspects of it to which she objects and which have
given naturalism its reputation for pessimism. These resolutions occur
primarily through the shift in focus from the individual will to the will of
the collective---a shift that is both a hallmark much utopian fiction and a
constitutive feature of the garden ideology.
