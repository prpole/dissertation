## Revision Goals

- **More fully integrate my critique of Gilman and the good Anthropocene, both
with each other and with the rest of my argument.** Gilman's ecological ethic is
marred by: a simplification of ecology to something that can be known
absolutely and can be precisely guided by a single actor; a uchronistic
disavowal of actual historical injustices through the container of Herland's
own history of slavery and eugenics; a lack of room for difference of identity
and political dissensus. These shortcomings are much easier to see in a version
of the good Anthropocene from 1915, when the assumptions on which it is based
were condoned and even commonplace. But many of these same problems persist
a century later in articulations of similar perspectives.

- **Consider ways in which FORM figures into this chapter.** I realize I'm
talking about this as though it were a work of theory rather than a novel. I'd
therefore like to focus on the ways that Gilman's use of setting and
world-building help construct her "ambient" economy while also contributing to
the suppression of ethical and ecological complexity. I'm particularly
interested in some of the tension between the way she collapses narration into
"setting" and the ways "backgrounding" human and non-human nature have been
justifications for colonial domination.

- **Clarify and streamline argument**. This chapter gets a bit ponderous at
times, and even repetitive, partially because it is a mix of old and new
writing. But I also think that some restructuring may be in order, here:
I might combine the first half of the "ambient labor" section (everything up
until ambient labor itself is introduced) and the "Inhabitation/Coevolution"
section to try to consolidate my argument about setting and backgrounding.
I think this could also help me connect the Lester Ward section a little more
clearly with what follows it. The structure would then be:

1. Introduction

2. Lester Ward

3. World-Building, Backgrounding, and Coevolution

4. Ambient Labor

5. Utopian Naturalism/Conclusion

My concern about this structure is that it would defer the "ambient labor"
concept too long.
