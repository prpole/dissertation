[Brief, punchy opening that contains the argument, in the form of "many think
x about Herland, but Y"]

> “It was a butterfly that made me a forester,” said Ellador. “I was about
eleven years old, and I found a big purple and green butterfly on a low flower.
I caught it, very carefully, by the closed wings, as I had been told to do, and
carried it to the nearest insect teacher---” (I [Vandyck] made a note there to
ask her what on earth an insect teacher was) “to ask her its name. She took it
from me with a little cry of delight. ‘Oh, you blessed child…. This is a female
of the obernut moth,’ she told me, ‘they are almost gone. We have been trying
to exterminate them for centuries. If you had not caught this one, it might
have laid eggs enough to raise worms enough to destroy thousands of our nut
trees---thousands of bushels of nuts,---and make years and years of trouble for
us.’

This passage exemplifies the ecological logic that recurs in *Herland*, and it
also gives us a hint of why a traditional ecocritical reading of the novel so
quickly becomes problematic. Gilman's ecological thinking in this moment is far
from "deep ecology," a conservationist movement premised on the fundamental
value of all living things. Indeed, it hardly seems to value "nature" at all in
any of the modes we are used to seeing---as the sublime, the untamed wild, or
in the more contemporary mode, as a fragile "other." 

[ That Gilman turns away from these commonplaces does not mean she is unaware of
them, of course. Indeed, she sets up the expectation of a sentimental
appreciation of the natural world, narrating what appears to be a tender
embrace of an aestheticized butterfly. But it is an expectation that she
emphatically reverses. First, the creature becomes an object of study,
something to be brought to an "insect teacher" for further instruction. By the
end of the passage, we realize that Ellador's careful pursuit of the obernut
moth will ultimately culminate in the its death---as well as what may be the
last stage in the deliberate extinction of an entire species. ]

To appreciate nature in Herland, then, means to understand it and to transform
the “natural” into a system that maximizes benefit to humans---and also the
fictional obernut tree, but only incidentally. Understanding web of
interrelations among the organisms in question, they have created a situation
in which nurturing their environment will mean nurturing themselves (123). 

The same is true for the entire environment of Herland: there is no "wild"
nature to contend with, but only heavily mediated semi-natural systems that
have been in some way been touched by Herland's human inhabitants. The
decisions and actions taken by Herlanders as a collective have a clear
deterministic influence on the development of every other species. 

To frame the issue in this way makes clear *Herland*'s relevance to the
Anthropocene, a term introduced in 200? by Gregory Crutzen to mark a new
geological epoch defined by collective human activity. But if Gilman
anticipates the terms of this discourse, she hardly shares its tone, which is
often apocalyptic where Gilman is triumphal. Herein lies one of the apparent
contradictions at the heart of Gilman's ecological sensibility. On one hand,
she recognizes the insurmountable pressures of a growing human species on the
"full world" of Herland, a geographically isolated land on a "high spur of
rock". On the other hand, however, her resolution of this pressure is not to
lessen human impact, but to make it even more total and deterministic; not to
become less anthropocentric in our conceptions of nature, but infinitely more. 

To understand this contradiction, we must revisit the influence of Lester F.
Ward on Gilman's writing and thinking. Ward's influence has been
comprehensively demonstrated, but the specifically ecological cast to this
influence has not been as fully explored. 

In the time that remains, I will discuss the role of the then-nascent field of
ecology in Ward's *Dynamic Sociology*, as well as some of the details of his
own intellectual influences and education, to show that Ward's approach to
ecology and resource management constitute a theory of the "good
Anthropocene"---a term common to contemporary theories of the Anthropocene that
argue for more *guidance* in human determination of environmental systems
rather than a lessening of that determination entirely. 

I will then focus on one of the ways that Gilman extrapolates from the
ecological insights of Ward's seminal work in the realm of economics. She
imagines a system of "ambient labor," a materialist resolution of human and
natural systems in which economics and ecology become coextensive. This form of
labor puts human laborers in the "background," and values human labor according
to its contribution to the production of a better environment---whether that
means the natural environment, the social environment, or the built
environment. 

To begin, then, with Lester Ward:

***

That Gilman's friendship with Lester Ward had a significant impact on her work
will not be a revelation to most Gilman scholars. Much of the critical debate
has concerned the extent and nature of this influence, but most commentators
unite in focusing primarily on their shared belief in an originary
"gynaecocentric" culture and a corresponding evolutionary method of female
sexual selection [@allen 59-61]. They also concur, if largely implicitly, that
examining this influence illuminates Gilman's fiction and non-fiction alike.
Cynthia J. Davis points out that such influence is especially significant given
Gilman's vision, articulated in *The Man-Made World, or Our Androcentric
Culture*, of a theoretically engaged fiction that would "teach not by preaching
but by truly re-presenting," often with the explicit goal of forwarding or
countering the works of other theorists [qtd. in @davis 73]. 

But these studies of Gilman and Ward, though deeply interested in their shared
sociological and evolutionary theories, overlook the extent to which Ward's
sociology arose out of a foundation of studies of the natural environment and
conservationism. Many of these critics mention an important fact in the
background of Ward's work as a mere biographical aside, without accounting for
it in their reading of Gilman: namely, that Ward spent the formative years in
which he wrote his first and most influential work, *Dynamic Sociology*, as the
chief paleobotanist for the U.S. Geological Survey. 

These years would give Ward the time and space to begin his career as
a sociologist, but they would also steep him in the nascent field of ecology (?
am I using ecology as a catchall here?) and the American conservation movement.
He worked under the guidance of John Wesley Powell, the founder of the USGS and
an early voice urging stewardship of the land to replace the purely extractive
relationship with it that had prevailed, until the conservation movement,
unchallenged. Powell's work was in turn built on the foundation of George
Perkins Marsh's revolutionary work, *Man and Nature: Or, Physical Geography as
Modified by Human Action*, which was extremely influential in the decades after
it was published and has come back into focus now as one of the earliest key
texts in the history of the Anthropocene as a theory---Marsh polemically
asserts that "human action must rank among *geological* influences," thereby
laying the groundwork for a geological epoch defined by an expansion of that
geological influence [@marsh 464]. John R. Ross, in a study of the origins of
the conservation movement, draws a direct line of influence from Marsh to
Powell to Ward, saying that Powell "read Marsh's work and remembered the
lessons" in his own work, and that Powell was the "seminal leader" for Ward's
labors both on the Geological Survey and, to a lesser extent, in his early
writing [@ross 52-3]. 

The context of Ward's early work, then, is defined by progenitors of the idea
that the human species is at the center of apparently "natural" systems---even
as early as the end of the nineteenth century, and even where human influence
was not directly visible. The impact of these figures is evident throughout
*Dynamic Sociology*, but especially where Ward discusses the wastefulness of
agriculture and industry. For example, he writes:

> The natural resources of the earth are squandered with a wanton disregard of
the future. The forests are cut down to supply temporary wants, consumed by
escaping campfires, or purposely cleared for tillage, until the habitable
portions of the earth are successively transformed into lifeless deserts. The
soil is rapidly exhausted by the first occupants, who know only the immediate
present. The wild animals useful to man are soon extinguished by the heartless
destruction of the fertile females and helpless young. [@ward 89]

As a rule, human encounters with the natural environment despoliate it, and
what is left behind is an exhausted waste land. And yet, for Ward, the wasteful
methods of human activity are not *against* nature, but merely an expression of
nature's own natural tendencies. He argues that the "wasteful methods [that]
prevail in society" are merely the same "as in the animal and vegetable
kingdoms," for "nature acts on the assumption that her resources are
inexhaustible" [@ward 87-8]. Where Marsh and Powell tended to see conservation
as protecting nature from human rapacity, Ward sees wastefulness as a natural
extension of the very wildness that defines nature itself. 

Herein lies the same paradox we will see in Gilman's *Herland*. On one hand,
human actions tend to have a detrimental and determinative effect on the
natural systems in which they intervene. But on the other hand, natural systems
left to their own devices are often unremittingly destructive, and at least as
"wasteful" as humanity itself---as in the case of the "obernut moth" in the
passage from Herland with which I began, which would obliterate the population
of the most productive nut trees in Herland if left to its own devices.

As with the Herlanders, Ward's solution to the excesses of unchecked natural
system is to manage them. But in his system, managing nature means managing
humanity itself, for we are "an integral part of this great unconscious
creative whole called nature, only a minute fraction of which can by any
possible means be brought within the range of his experience" [@ward 11].
Conversely, if humanity is simultaneously part of nature and managing it, we
must also be understood in this system as *nature's means of managing itself*.
Ward sees the human as unique in that our processes are "teleologic[al]" rather
than "genetic." But because we are still part of nature, nature's activity
*becomes* teleological through us, as we use purposive action to guide the
development of the entire system. Ward thus imagines the human as both the apex
of evolution and evolution's replacement, the means of replacing genetic
development with teleological development. It is as though all of non-human
nature were a body devoted to growing the head that would guide its further
actions. 

Ward's way out of humanity's detrimental and determinative influence is
therefore, paradoxically, to recognize ourselves as part of the natural systems
of which we are also the guides. This theorization of the human-nature
relationship anticipates the Anthropocene to the extent that it conceives of
humanity as a defining force within the interlocking natural systems of the
earth. And while it
