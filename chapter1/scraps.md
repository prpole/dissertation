<!-- due process: If there is a program of guided *genetic* evolution, it
would appear to be through a collective decision of which Herlanders
reproduce---which, of course, leads to a different sort of problem. In
a peculiar departure from the precedent set by Thomas More's *Utopia* and
followed by many utopian novels since, Gilman decides not to illuminate the
decision-making process. The result is a worrying appearance of centralized
authority: even though there appears to be a society-wide consensus regarding
the values and direct actions of Herland as a state, we are never allowed to
see how this consensus comes about. This is particularly troubling when
considering who is allowed to reproduce, as there is no guarantee of respect
for individual rights or authority over the processes of one's own life and
body. Just as *Herland* predicts many of the environmental insights of the
post-war period, then, it appears to predict some of its controversies. The
antagonism between environmental stewardship and a booming population would
come to a head soon after the birth of the modern environmental movement,
particularly in the work of Garrett Hardin, Paul Ehrlich, and others.-->



## uh thesis...


<!--

In *Herland*, Gilman offers an anticipation of "good Anthropocene" thinking,
acknowledging the scale of human influence on the environment while suggesting
that this influence should be guided rather than lessened. But Gilman's good
Anthropocene realizes what more contemporary formulations of it too often miss:
namely, that if embracing human control of natural systems can lead to a more
sustainable world ecology, we will have to rethink some of the fundamental human
categories that have been most impactful. The Herlanders' reevaluation of
labor, value, and inhabitation become the basis of their survival in the face
of circumstances comparable to those of a full, overtaxed, and deteriorating
planet.

## metabolism section and others

Gilman extends the mutual determination of nature and culture to its logical
conclusion by exploring a process of literal and cultural *coevolution*, not
between two discreet species of organism (as commonly occurs in the non-human
natural world), but between the human and its environment entire. The
evolutionary system that Gilman accepts is an idiosyncratic one. In line with
the rest of the slippage between organism and environment in the novel, she
assumes a semi-Lamarckian stance of species development that emphasizes the
role of environment in physical evolution. Like Lamarck, she considers the
possibility that acquired traits can be passed on to other generations, which
gives environmental determinants an outsized influence on the development of
a species. Taking environment as a significant determining factor in evolution
also brings the creation of culture into the evolutionary equation: Gilman uses
education, a fundamental part of the Herland culture, as a way to guide the
management of the physical environment, depicting a society that, in
determining its environment’s development, simultaneously guides its *own*
development. The resultant coevolutionary system foregrounds the interaction of
the human with the natural world in its conception of a continued human
evolution. By depicting this process as a result of social reform and control
of the built environment, Gilman frames her work as well as that of her
contemporary feminist reformers as interventions in the evolutionary process.
She goes further still in illustrating the dialectical evolutionary paradigm
that enables the existence of *Herland* in what should be conditions of extreme
scarcity. 

Simply put, Gilman has developed a garden system that is able to operate in
conditions of extreme spatial and ecological limitation by rejecting the
concomitance of growth and development and refusing the separation of human and
non-human systems, whether those systems are flows of energy, ecological
systems, or even evolutionary ones. [In the following sections, the specifics of
how she incorporates human labor into an ecology (both socially and materially)
will be expanded upon significantly. But to discuss a vision of near-total
environmental determinism like this one, discussing social structures requires
a discussion of the speculative world itself---and in this case, how the
construction of that world constitutes a type of argumentation.]

<!--
This system of non-competitive coevolution is at the foundation
of Gilman’s garden society, but can be seen as part of a much larger
sociological and scientific trajectory beginning in the nineteenth century.
Though she was not influenced by Marx---she was vocal about her distaste for
Marx and Marxism, in large part because of the depiction of women and women's
labor in his work[^ln-gilman-marxism]---his concept of the “metabolism” between
humanity and nature nevertheless bears strong resemblance to the coevolutionary
paradigm in *Herland*. Marx’s social metabolism (*Stoffwechsel*) is at the
center of John Bellamy Foster’s book *Marx’s Ecology*, in which he demonstrates
the influence of a materialist conception of the natural world on Marx’s
thinking, and rebuts claims that Marx is an anti-ecological proponent of
industrial development at the expense of the natural world. The metabolism of
human and nature constitutes a set of “evolving material relations” in which
the human’s simultaneous dependence on and alteration of its environment
determine the circular, material exchange between them (Foster 11, 155-60).
Labor becomes, in Marx’s view, 

> a process between man and nature…by which man, through his own actions,
mediates, regulates and controls the metabolism between himself and
nature.…Through this movement [of the laboring body] he acts upon external
nature and changes it, and in this way he simultaneously changes his own
nature. (qtd. in Foster 157)

For labor to be an effective mediation of the system, though, it must be
“actual labor,” which produces only the material wealth of use-value (157). In
other words, it has to be a system like Herland’s that eschews the market
entirely. The material interchange that defines this concept derives in large
part from the rise of “energetics” in the physical sciences in the 1840s and
1850s, leading to a particular emphasis in Marx’s metabolic system on the
possible enrichment and degradation of soil found in the work of James Anderson
and Justus von Liebig (Foster 144-9, 161). Because the metabolism depends on
the energetics of soil, the separation of town and country causes a “rift” that
leads to the gradual despoliation of the environment (141-5). Unregulated
production and disharmony between the built and natural environments, two of
the concepts most heavily revised in Gilman’s system of coevolution, are the
factors that Marx identifies as disruptors of the metabolism. 

[^ln-gilman-marxism]: See for example Denise D. Knight’s biography of Gilman:
“With other socialists of her background and inclinations, Charlotte distrusted
Marx and preferred to rely on the intellectual labors of a native-born
intelligentsia that included herself.…For the most part, she sought her desired
economic transformations within the capitalist system even while criticizing
that system for its intrinsically patriarchal attitudes and practices” (197).
Gilman herself provides additional detail in her autobiography, *The Living of
Charlotte Perkins Gilman*, saying, “My socialism was of the early humanitarian
kind, based on the first exponents, French and English, with the American
enthusiasm of Bellamy. The narrow and rigid ‘economic determinism’ of Marx,
with its ‘class consciousness’ and ‘class struggle’ I never accepted, nor the
political methods pursued by Marxians” (131). Although Gilman’s own distaste
for Marxism has kept it out of much Gilman scholarship, the similarity of the
concept of the “metabolism” discussed below is extremely useful comparatively,
both in bringing out the specifics and implications of Gilman’s own ecology and
placing her in the larger intellectual context of her time (even the parts of
that context that she might not place herself in).

Considering this metabolic system in relation to *Herland*, we see the
relationship of Gilman’s evolutionary system to the garden environment and the
consequent system of labor, and specifically the way world-building and
community-building are related dialectically through labor. Environmental management, achieved through a reversion to the
“actual labor” that produces only use-value, is a means of guiding the complex
material interchange essential to the coevolution of the Herlanders and
Herland. In order to effect meaningful change on this front, the Herlanders
have to change their own practices and culture, which they do in part by
altering their material environment. 


Coevolution is the foundation of Gilman’s garden---a “vegetable garden mind
you!, not merely flowers”: it allows identity of sustenance with the sustained,
simultaneity of the built and the natural, and cyclical reproduction in tandem
with evolutionary progress. The three elements of Gilman’s evolutionary
paradigm (genetics, environment, and education) work in a mutually reinforcing
system. Education instills the values of an environmental management in which
the self is included, guiding the creation and maintenance of an environment
that Gilman believes is the determinant of genetic variation and physical
transmutation. The principles of the sustaining garden finally bring social and
physical evolution into harmony. 

The question remains of how to approach a system of evolution that is marred
from one side by ethical problems and from the other by retrospective
scientific inaccuracy. To begin on an ethical (and negative) level, this
tripartite system does not enable us to dismiss the problematics of race and
eugenics in *Herland*, but they may complicate the understanding of the system
in the same way that understanding Gilman’s reliance on Lester F. Ward does;
recognizing such connections allows us to better place Gilman in an
historicizing context, even if it does not (and should not) allow us to hold
her system up as an exact roadmap. 

This speculative evolutionary system does come into useful focus, however, when
we consider it in terms of the utopian function of the novel. If we
provisionally take utopian fiction as a speculative fulfillment of problems
deriving from the author's historical present---a process sympathetic to
Frederic Jameson’s concept of aesthetic resolutions to real problems, though
perhaps not identical with it[^ln-jameson]---the usefulness of Gilman’s
evolutionary narrative becomes more conceivable. The next section will bring
the issues of labor and evolution discussed above to bear on *Herland*’s
ecotopian function, asking how its utopian response to the common tropes of
American literary naturalism can bring it into greater contact with the
concerns of the Environmental Humanities.

Unconscious*.

## cut from end


Precisely that ease and totality should be a source of pause for anyone
evaluating *Herland* as a case study, for a double ominous silence pervades the
novel in its failure to address questions: Where is the state? and Where is the
room for dissensus? The voices of those Herlanders not permitted to reproduce
(or forced to reproduce) by the will of the majority should remind us of
everything that is subtly horrifying in the novel, and serve as a reminder that
it is to be approached with some caution and skepticism. The whole task of
guiding human development puts an enormous weight on the question of how such
decisions are made equitably, and it is precisely this issue to which Gilman
devotes the least attention.

Nevertheless, Gilman's utopian naturalism---with all the mutual determination
of the individual with social, economic, and ecological systems that it
implies---is what makes her version of the garden society distinct from other
images of the "garden" more familiar to the American literary canon. Its
material-cultural continuum that posits environmental praxis as a fundamental
aspect of political praxis. Indeed, in the utopian naturalist system,
environmental praxis is logically anterior to any meaningful political change,
because it understands environment as an absolute determinant of political and
cultural structures, even if that determination is mutual. 

*Herland*'s understanding that human and natural systems are inseparable leads
her to the structures I have exposed here, and the resulting system both
predicts what we now call social ecology and repurposes the determinism assumed
by American literary naturalism. Where Gilman exceeds Leo Marx's other
examples, then, is in its insistence on communal, material praxis as a means of
transcending natural and economic limitations. But it also differs from other
gardens in its understanding of the human as just one more element that makes
up the garden system. 

### Conclusion: Transition Narratives and the Steady-State System (?)

When it is viewed as an environmentalist text, more can be taken from *Herland*
than a snapshot of a once-progressive system of thought. The novel can be
considered as part of a literary canon of transition from a status quo based on
growth, capitalism, and ecological destruction to a future based on
steady-state development and a truly ecological society. *Herland* can be
considered a narrative of transition because of its obvious resonances with
localism and the sustainable forestry its conditions of scarcity require. But
in addition, Herland's own foundational myth is one of transition from a
civilization embedded in a larger ecosystem and political network to one that
is materially independent.[^ln-herlands-transition] In this context, the
miracle of parthenogenesis becomes a larger symbol of autochthony and
self-regeneration in terms that go well beyond the human.

[^ln-herlands-transition]: Find the passages about Herland's foundation myth.

"Transition" is a term that has gained global prominence in the past decades
with the rise of the "transition network," a loose organization of communities
committed to becoming less dependent on global flows of energy in general and
fossil fuel economies in particular.[^ln-rob-hopkins] The role of aesthetics
and narrative in this process of transition has so far been focused on our
relationships to energy systems: in *Living Oil* (2014), for example, Stephanie
LeMenager reads "physical infrastructure against artistic forms" to "explore
how social affects might be shifted toward a different-looking and -feeling
post-petroleum future" (68). She discusses the movement primarily in terms of
its relevance to "peak oilers," anti-oil activists who use narratives of
transition to imagine not just the end of oil, but what is on the other side of
it---imagined infrastructures and energy systems along with replacements for
the affective connections with aspects of our culture that LeMenager argues are
inseparable from our energy infrastructure (66-8).[^lemenager-transitions] A
literary canon of transition cannot stop with energy systems, though. More
fundamental contradictions exist between human systems and the ecologies that
contain them, and literatures of economic and cultural transition will also
demand to be read.

[^ln-rob-hopkins]: a few notes on rob hopkins, transition network, some sources

A vision like Gilman's, however utopian, could be very instructive indeed in
the context of this emergent literature of transition to a post-fossil-fuel
economy and the recent eruption into the mainstream of "cli-fi."[^clifi] Of
course, *Herland* is far from perfect and even further from a roadmap. Even if
we ignore the magical premise, we have to content with the Malthusian
population control, "refinement" through eugenics, and the impossibility of
dissensus. That is to say that we see some of the same grave challenges that
have plagued other precursors to and early forms of environmentalism. But
pursuing a literary canon of transition will mean taking literature as a
staging ground for those challenges, not as a magic mirror that only shows a
perfect world---even when a utopian novel may think it is providing just that.
*Herland* can be a fulcrum for putting pressure on an ideology of localism
that, as Paul Gilroy complained in reference to Raymond Williams, is not
sufficiently separated from racist nationalisms. In working through *Herland*,
we have to ask how to disentangle the material necessity of localism from the
cultural necessity of cultural inclusiveness.

Reading a novel as a novel of transition also implies a certain *method* of
reading with elements of surface reading rooted in a context of materialism.
Like LeMenager's task of reading "physical infrastructure against artistic
forms," I propose to take seriously the spatial organization and material
interventions in the ecology and infrastructure that are elaborated in the
interstices of *Herland*'s loose narrative. These details can reveal both the
conceptual place of Gilman's particular ecotopian imagination in American
environmental thought and the moments where she exceeds or adds to that
thinking.

<br>

In this expanded environmental of Gilman’s utopian novel, we can see her
speculative society as a garden-based model of transition. She represents a
submerged counternarrative of the garden image in American literature: one that
has less to do with the Edenic, expansionist visions of her contemporaries than
with the more sophisticated and politically astute gardens of the past fifty
years. As a figure of American literature, she offers a way of opposing the
simplistic determinism and social Darwinism so often attributed to naturalist
fiction, all the while marshaling an altered version of these concepts to
delineate a non-exploitative system of labor that resists, even counteracts,
the despoliation of the environment. To write with some reference to literary
naturalism, a genre uniquely concerned with reflecting reality, is for Gilman a
way of addressing the reality that actually is---just as the utopian function
of her brand of naturalism is a way of creating the reality that should be.
Additionally, the concept of the garden puts Gilman in context as an early if
unorthodox figure in American environmentalism on top of her stable if
controversial position in the history of American feminism. Certainly all
accounts of her work have had to grapple with such multiple axes of
consideration: the socialist, the feminist, the environmentalist, the utopian
thinker. Just as the plants in a well-planned garden, the conversations that
inhere in *Herland* exist in complex interrelation, each offsetting and
nurturing the others, together forming a multifarious and complicated whole.

###Note: This is the old conclusion; parts of it will become footnotes and/or incorporated into an introduction to the "Utopian naturalism" section.

The literary context and thematic content of *Herland* invite a reading of it
in terms of American literary naturalism, and indeed Gilman features as an
occasional figure in (especially contemporary) criticism on naturalism. The
difficulty of considering the novel in these terms, however, comes from the
notoriously vexed term “naturalism” itself. The only obvious consensus in
contemporary criticism of the movement is a rejection of a straw-man
descriptions of it in which individual agency is seen as always subjugated to
an uncomplicated determinism. Beyond this, any foray into naturalism seems to
come with either a radical reworking of the category or, as in the case of
Walter Benn Michaels in *The Gold Standard and the Logic of Literary
Naturalism*, an explicit desire to “avoid that debate entirely” (26). But the
stable threads that emerge as topics of conversation (if not arguments within
those topics) are distinct enough to admit the category as evidence and
consider the ways that Gilman is wading into these intellectual and artistic
streams. The most commented-upon of these topics is the relationship of
individual agency to deterministic forces, 

 Jennifer L. Fleissner’s *Women, Compulsion,
Modernity* resolves this tension in part with the concept of *compulsion*, in
which individual agency and “rationalizing ‘forces’ appear as more deeply
intertwined,” nature becomes an important actor in social life, and compulsive
ordering rituals arise as a mediation between the free and determined versions
of the self (9-10). In addition to the determination question, the relevance of
natural law and scientific knowledge to social, political, and economic life is
paramount to most definitions of naturalism, with Mark Seltzer notably arguing
in *Bodies and Machines* that the naturalist novel unites industrial production
with biological reproduction, and that it also responds to the realist premise
of linear narrative continuity by “map[ping] in high relief…the evolutionary
dynamics” of that continuity (43). A third trend of scholarship on naturalism
is to point out the archetypal plot of a character’s “degeneration” into a
figure truly determined by base desires, a trope associated especially with
Frank Norris’s *Vandover the Brute*.^[See for example Seltzer, 36-7.] Each of
these three topics is evident as a theme in *Herland*: a combination of
environmental, biological, and social determinism undergirds her depiction of
coevolutionary praxis; the blending of nature and culture has been discussed at
length above; and the possibility of degeneration into a “brute” dominated by
masculine urges is implicit in the immediate imprisonment of the male intruders
and the defensive stance assumed by the Herlanders.

It is primarily by building on Jennifer Fleissner’s reading of *Herland* in
*Women, Compulsion, Modernity*, however, that my own discussion can come to
bear on the question of literary naturalism. Fleissner’s 2004 intervention into
the study of naturalism has been acknowledged by many reviewers as a major
shift in the terms of the critical conversation, with Hildegard Hoeller,
reviewing the book for *American Literature*, calling it “an altogether new
view of naturalist writing” that leaves our view of the movement “usefully
expanded” (188). By shifting the focus of naturalism to the changing role of
women in the 1890s and the early 20th century, Fleissner reveals the repetitive
motion of compulsion that undergirds, as Rita Felski puts it, “women’s
problematic relationship to historical time” (282). Considering some of the
garden-like aspects of *Herland* in relation to the garden that surrounds the
house of “The Yellow Wallpaper,” which she calls as a “liminal space, neither
home nor wilderness” that “solves the problem of the too-natural ‘outside’ and
the too-cultural ‘inside,’” Fleissner argues that *Herland* should be seen as
“a ‘realist’ response on Gilman’s part to the troubling ‘naturalist’ vision of
the attempt at order manifested in her own earlier story” (95). In this
reading, the obsessional need to order that is so crippling (because its
realization is impossible) in “The Yellow Wallpaper” becomes the foundation of
Gilman’s imagined community, and compulsive domesticity drives “the utopian
social vision that would render the earlier story an obsolete relic” (87-95).
In the context of her larger argument, *Herland* is a feminist alternative to
the literary “West Cure”^[A pun on the “rest cure,” which Gilman was herself
prescribed and which figures in “The Yellow Wallpaper.”] that she takes as a
defining feature of masculine naturalism; in “The Great Indoors” of this
feminine West Cure, domesticity is supposed to perform for women the
therapeutic rehabilitation that young men were alleged to get from “going West”
and contending with the elements, freeing themselves from the teacups and
Victorian parlors of realist fiction (75-98). 

The extent to which domesticity can be taken as a “realist” fix for the
“naturalist” problems of “The Yellow Wallpaper” relies on these definitions of
naturalism and realism.^[For another take on Gilman’s response to naturalism in
her essays from *The Forerunner*, see Christopher P. Wilson’s “Charlotte
Perkins Gilman's Steady Burghers: The Terrain of Herland.”] But the garden of
*Herland* as I have described it here can be seen as an attempt to resolve more
aspects of naturalism^[Such attempts to “resolve” other literary paradigms are
not unprecedented in Gilman’s body of work and its criticism. See Jennifer S.
Tuttle’s “Gilman’s *The Crux* and Owen Wister’s *The Virginian*:
Intertextuality and ‘Woman’s Manifest Destiny’” for another reading of Gilman
responding to masculinist literary production.] than the problems that arise
from the domesticity embodied in the imprisoning leisure garden of “The Yellow
Wallpaper”---though resolving these is certainly much of *Herland*’s project.
Norris 

The complex interrelation of economy, ecology, domesticity, and evolutionary
theory presents a wider rejoinder, not only to the gated garden of Gilman’s own
earlier “naturalism,” but also to the “rank” and “tangled” vegetation of the
wilderness that stands in for a naturalist view of nature defined by
“Darwinist” competition, non-productivity, and despair. The first things that
Vandyck and the other intruders learn, the condition of their understanding the
Herland garden, is the anti-competitive lesson of the stone-throwing game; the
expansive view of cooperative growth among humans and other organisms, which
defines the economy and ecology of Gilman’s garden, reforms the men who
represent something very external to the circuit between *Herland* and “The
Yellow Wallpaper,” something that extends the argument about domesticity beyond
its initial scope. Widening the focus of Gilman’s response beyond the domestic
in this way requires an addition to the description of *Herland* as “realist”
in Fleissner’s sense. In accepting many of the topics common to the naturalist
novel and revising them with a vision of what happens under certain conditions
of cooperation, Gilman invents a kind of utopian naturalism.^[The term “utopian
naturalism” also allows us to consider *Herland* as a response to naturalism
without losing the rich contextualization of the novel within the utopian
generic tradition. Gilman herself has been very explicit about her interest
especially in Bellamy’s *Looking Backward*, and considering the work in generic
terms is a useful means of approaching the novel. It contextualizes, for
example, the satirical take on the present simultaneous with a programmatic
projection of the future, a feature Frederic Jameson (reading Ernst Bloch)
identifies with Thomas More’s *Utopia* in “Morus: The Generic Window”. The
definitive work on Gilman’s relationship to the idea of utopia and its
corresponding literature is Carol Farley Kessler’s *Charlotte Perkins Gilman:
Her Progress Toward Utopia with Selected Writings*.] This utopian naturalism
accepts many of the premises associated with naturalist writing---some measure
of determinism, the relevance of natural law and scientific theory to social
life, and the need to guard against degeneration---while resolving by way of
the utopian premise those aspects of it to which she objects and which have
given naturalism its reputation for pessimism. These resolutions occur
primarily through the shift in focus from the individual will to the will of
the collective---a shift that is both a hallmark much utopian fiction and a
constitutive feature of the garden ideology. 




## Gilman panel proposal

Building on Charlotte Perkins Gilman's well known connection to Lester Ward and
her use of the "garden" as a paradigm for anthropogenic environmental change,
this paper will seek to identify Charlotte Perkins Gilman as a literary
contributor to the intellectual history of the Anthropocene. As Cynthia J.
Davis has shown, Gilman's *Herland* can be seen as a utopian, fictional
extrapolation of Ward's theories on women and evolution (73). But it is also
likely that *Herland*'s clear ecological consciousness is influenced by his
study of ecology, which was in turn influenced by the work of George Perkins
Marsh---a naturalist regarded as an early theorist of the Anthropocene in all
but name (Lowenthal 56). Serving as the Chief Paleontologist of the U.S.
Geological Survey while he wrote his influential *Dynamic Sociology*, Ward was
mentored by a disciple of Marsh's work, with whom he regularly exchanged ideas
on topics in philosophy and ecology alike (Ross 51-2). Gilman, meanwhile, was
not just an avid reader of Ward's work, but a longtime friend and correspondent
with Ward himself (Davis 73-4). The chain of influence will require further
research to characterize fully, but it is clear that all parties (excluding
Marsh) were engaged in an active exchange of ideas and, at times, were
collaborators. 

After demonstrating Gilman's relevance to the foundations of Anthropocene
thinking, this paper will examine some of the ways in which *Herland* merges
human and natural system. Herland's utopian social structure is based on what
I will call "ambient labor" and in the communal resource management Herlanders
are taught from birth. Instead of jobs and agriculture, Herlanders have roles
in the larger system, which they are constantly altering through some form of
political consensus. The environment, rather than being coerced or exploited,
is shaped from the soil up in such a way that it merely *provides*
autonomously. Any "production" in this system is primarily the production of
"environment" itself, and through this system Gilman renders the economic
activity of Herland as part of a larger ecological exchange of energy and
matter. This idiosyncratic version of the human-nature relationship falls in
between the relationships envisioned by Marsh and Ward, respectively. Through
the male interlopers who serve as the novel's protagonists, Gilman acknowledges
an ecological present defined by Marsh's version of anthropogenic environmental
change, which he sees as always destructive. But in Herland itself, she
imagines the conditions necessary to enable Ward's vision of the human as the
apex of evolution and as an agent to replace natural selection---that is,
anthropogenic change as primarily benign and part of a larger social evolution.
Gilman's place in the context of ecological thought can be defined by the
tension between these two poles---a tension that is historically rooted while
still being germane to contemporary thinking on the Anthropocene.


## Beginning chapter draft

[ "kill kill kill" essay ]

This essay was written [ x ] years after *Herland*, and it was never
published---her publisher said it [ ]. Nevertheless, it contains many of the
tensions that 


## outline-ish

1. intro

    a. set up Gilman/Ward as acknowledging the Anthropocene while attempting to
assert it as the rightful order---if only best practices are followed; buttress
with Blackwell

    b. this is undeniably Anthropocenic---the context of Marsh, Ward's history
with him; historically she finds herself definitely situated in the beginnings
of Anthropocene thinking, or more specifically, in one of the first
anthropocentric counterpoints to the tenets of the Anthropocene as synonymous
with apocalypse (Marsh on the end of the planet, here; context on Ward)

    c. Gilman embodies, "re-presenting" Ward (Davis), the principles of the
"good" Anthropocene, which has gained momentum as the official announcement of
the epoch grows closer. 

        i. mvmt essentially tries to figure out sustainable principles/more
invasive guidance of natural processes to make inevitable human influence of
ecosystems in which they are embedded something other than apocalyptic

        ii. we can see in Ward the roots of this movement (humanity as apex and
inheritor of evolutionary process)

        iii. in both cases such a benign guiding hand requires robust social
programs and a strong communal will to guide human influence of non-human
nature

    d. But Gilman's novella also embodies an ethical problem that is more
rarely mooted in Anthropocene discourse. She positions the human as
simultaneously the steward and of an ecosystem and a cornerstone component of
it; the changes that the human enacts (wilfully and otherwise) on the system as
a whole also alter the human. Environmental ethics become part and parcel of
human ethics, and vice versa. Artificial selection is taken to what would now
be understood as its *reductio ad absurdum*, resulting in a program of
voluntary eugenics. She demonstrates, in essence, the entanglement of two
fundamental problems: extending human ethics to non-human parts of the
ecosystem and considering the human ecologically (with all the wilful checks
and balances that implies). 

    e. We should therefore understand *Herland* as a meditation on the
embeddedness of human and natural systems, even if we have to resist its
utopian outcomes. By incorporating these disparate systems into one larger one,
she demonstrates the inseparability of politics and human ecology. Though often
naively at best---and monstrously at worst---she makes economics and ecology,
production and reproduction, and politics and planting completely coextensive.
While revealing the sustainable and environmentally progressive potential of
collective movements, she also exposes the extent to which such movements would
have to risk curtailing due process and democratic principles to achieve their
goals. Finally, she shows the potential for ecological optimism in literary
naturalism---a genre often derisively called "pessimistic realism" (Lukacs). In
thinking through these problematics (not to say resolving them), she creates
what we might refer to as a "utopian naturalism": a mobilization of the genre's
penchant for systems thinking to project speculative futures, futures that
ultimately rely on a faith in collective action. 



## other


At various points throughout her life, Charlotte Perkins Gilman lived in
experimental collectivist communities. When she was a teenager, to take an
early example, she went with her recently divorced mother to participate in a
cooperative housekeeping movement in Providence, Rhode Island. Though not
impressed---she left after a dispute with the psychic who led the cooperative
after a dispute over thoughts Gilman may or may not have had---it seems that
the experience set a precedent for Gilman’s own reformist ambitions (Davis
*Charlotte* 31-2).  Later she would life in communal households devoted to
social reform at a time when such design projects were seen as possible sites
of social change, though she apparently never stayed for long. Nevertheless,
the  From the first, environmental factors were related in Gilman’s life to
issues of labor and social reform; though a theme in much of her work, this
relationship does not ultimately come to fruition until the publication of
*Herland*.


The understanding of the society as itself a kind of garden surmounts and
contains all these, however, and taking this image as a conceptual frame for
the rest of the utopian vision re-contextualizes its defining features. Though
smaller iterations of the garden like those described above present subtly
different permutations of the its function in society, the framing garden is
consistently represented as an entity that is closed to the outside,
ecologically managed in order to preclude destructive competition, and defined
by an aesthetic that privileges functionality above all else. Recognizing the
garden as a frame reveals, on a socio-biological level, a view of
anti-competitive social Darwinism in which collective control of the
environment determines the development of the species. On the cultural and
economic level, it reveals a ludic revision of the work-ethic that keeps the
society at full employment while simultaneously eliminating labor as a discrete
activity. Finally, on the literary and critical level, the garden reveals a
polemical rejoinder to masculine naturalist writing that depicts environment as
a site of competition, competition as an empowerment of the individual, and the
individual as the driving force of society. That these diverse premises are all
presented in the same terms underscores the extent to which Gilman’s utopia is
predicated on the harmonious interleaving of the built and natural environments
that the garden represents.


[Marx's environmental definition of labor is a clear extension of Hegel's
account of self-consciousness, in which the bondsman comes to
self-consciousness in part through work on an external object. It is somewhat
ambiguous, however, how Hegel's highly individualistic development of self-
consciousness applies when, one, the agent doing the work is understood as a
community rather than an individual, and two, the "object" of construction is
understood as more than a blank canvas or mirror---when the nature of the
"object" of labor has just as much of an effect on the laborer as the reverse.
Hegel's bondsman comes to self-consciousness despite being subject to a
dominating lord by working on some external thing. The self-reflecting nature
of this work "passes into the form of the object," giving the laborer a
permanent, externalized artifact of that laborer's existence as an individual
(Hegel pars.  195-6). Marx gives a much greater import to the specificity of
this labor and its products than Hegel affords---the place of this type of
labor in his larger system seems to imply that at least the conditions of
production has a powerful determining effect on the laborer. But what both
leave out is the extent to which conscious choice over the effect and object of
labor can also be a form of self-construction. Self-consciousness in this sense
implies a static self at the moment of recognition that one comes to
consciousness of; but when the act of labor effects environment, and
environment determines the nature of the person, coming to consciousness
through work on the environment becomes a simultaneous awareness and
determination of the consciousness in question. That Gilman's understanding of
this process only comes into play on the scale of the community also demands a
reckoning with communal self-consciousness as a byproduct of communal
construction of self-through-environment. Her ambient labor, then, in
combination with the evolution of the community can form the basis of an
alternative paradigm to Hegel's highly individualistic model of
self-consciousness through work, in which communal self-consciousness is
developed through collective environmental construction. And the interaction of
culture and its material (ecological) base is therefore complex and
dialectical: by changing the land they change themselves, but they change the
land by changing how they relate to it.]

it is tempting to call Gilman's treatment of the Herland environment just one
more example of Leo Marx's "middle landscape," as some scholars have implicitly
done.[^li-wen-chang] It is certainly apt to describe Gilman's system in the
terms *The Machine in the Garden* delineates---were it better known by the
early '60s, *Herland* may well have been included. His "middle landscape" is a
space that is not entirely natural and not entirely cultural, but transcends
both while being somewhere between them; he creates a conceptual space for
thinking of a human development in more complicated relation to the natural
world, in which management and semi-utilitarian alteration does not strictly
have to be form of mastery. His rigorous intellectual history of the garden
shows that the vision of a land that simply provides in an Edenic (and
therefore garden-like) fashion has governed the American literary response to
nature from its earliest examples.  Gilman-like dreams of a natural world in
which "nature does virtually all of the work" and human and nature live in
"serene partnership" even show up in Roman examples of the pastoral (Leo Marx
23). The wish itself, then, is far from new, and neither is the despoliation
that inspires it.it is tempting to call Gilman's treatment of the Herland
