### Working Title: Environmental Speculation in American Literary Naturalism

Consider a series of novels in which the human population of a planet struggles
to meet its basic needs because the form of plant life they rely on for
sustenance has started to *fight back*. This plant is not supposed to grow
there in the first place: transported from another world, it has gained
a foothold in a foreign environment thanks to hubristic agricultural coercion
and controlled mutation, but before long it has come to span vast,
just-conquered landmasses. Not long after that it seems to have developed
a spirit of its own. The plant has whims, and the planet's human population
transforms its behavior to match them. A powerful financier attempts to
dominate the plant with market forces, despite the warnings of those who fear
it; when his life and his career are destroyed, the novel makes clear, it is
because this unmasterable force has asserted its almost mystical power in
retribution. Another would-be master of the plant is crushed beneath a wave of
its processed form, the plant's power asserted once again through sheer might.
On this planet dominated by a single non-human life form, in the "little,
isolate group of human insects, misery, death, and anguish spun like a wheel of
fire." And yet, "*the [plant] remained*. Untouched, unassailable, undefiled,
that mighty world-force, that nourisher of nations, wrapped in Nirvanic calm,
indifferent to the human swarm, gigantic, resistless, moved onward in its
appointed grooves" (Norris *The Octopus* 448).

This summary might sound like an advertisement for a sci-fi series in which
a monstrous plant controls a distant planet, perhaps an allegory for climate
change and our abused planet. In fact, the planet is Earth, the plant is wheat,
and the series of novels is comprised of *The Octopus* (1899) and *The Pit*
(1901), Frank Norris's classic novels of American literary naturalism. Such
confusion is possible on one hand because of the speculative nature of
environmentalist critique in many naturalist novels, and on the other because
environmentalist speculative fiction has continued many of the narrative
strategies and philosophical commitments of literary naturalism. Considering
literary naturalism with the Anthropocene in mind can therefore allow us to
cast the movement in a new light, but it can also provide us with a partial
literary pre-history of contemporary Anthropocene fictions.[^ln-trexler]

My dissertation will discuss environmental speculation in American literary
naturalism (henceforth "naturalism") both as a mode of proto-environmentalist
thought and as a precursor to an environmentalist strain of speculative
fiction, sometimes called "cli-fi" or "climate fiction," that would develop
over the rest of the century. By "environmental speculation" I mean the
narrative construction of possible environmental futures or hypothetical
alternatives to the dominant social ecology of the novel's historical moment.
As naturalism is a genre that deals heavily with the workings of capitalism and
finance, however, I also want to open the term up to consideration in terms of
"futures speculation" and its environmental impact---particularly in works by
London and Norris in which futures speculation is a major narrative
preoccupation, but also in works by Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Charles W.
Chesnutt in which critiques capitalist natures[^ln-capitalist-natures] are more
subtle. In each chapter, I will use mainlines of environmentalist speculative
fiction as starting points to discuss the concepts in the context of literary
naturalism, elaborating their logics in the earlier context before zooming out
to show how they developed into the forms they would eventually take as cli-fi.

<!--Relevance of cli-fi-->Cli-fi is quickly rising in prominence as the
twenty-first century continues, in no small part due to its immediate
contemporary relevance: it deals directly with climate change, which looks to
be the century's defining event, and in its inherent speculativeness it mirrors
the rapid technological and ecological change so characteristic of the age. Its
path somewhat cleared by the emergence of Anthropocene studies more generally,
cli-fi has found an academic reception commensurable with its retail success.
While much of the early discussion of the genre took place in commercial and
trade publications, including *Kirkus*, *The Guardian*, and *The New
Yorker*,[^ln-journo] in 2015 several academic books were released on the
topic,[^ln-academic-clifi] with more likely to come, and a cursory search for
syllabi with the keywords "climate change" or "Anthropocene" yields many hits.
<!--environmental sf beyond/before cli-fi -->Despite the recent urgency with
which it has been adopted, the movement is hardly new. Before there was cli-fi,
there was a longstanding vein of environmentalist thought in speculative
fiction, most notoriously in Frank Herbert's *Dune* (1965) and running through
the modern era in Kim Stanley Robinson's works of the 1980s and '90s. In fact,
the term "cli-fi" often indicates less an explicit concern with climatological
issues than merely a recent entry in the environmentalist SF tradition---only
now understood through the lens of a single overwhelming environmental issue.
Cli-fi, in these terms, far predates human consciousness of anthropogenic
climate change and the Anthropocene. More probably, it arises contemporaneously
with the rapid industrialization and financialization that began the long
twentieth century. 
 
<!--Statement of argument: literary naturalism is the predecessor of cli-fi,
but its own form of environmental speculation is understudied-->But the
literary and philosophical genealogy of the genre is more complex than it
appears, even with this expanded definition, and requires a discussion of
another genre entirely: the roots of cli-fi's environmental speculation can be
found in the tradition of American literary naturalism. Not only can, but
*should* be: naturalism was striving to represent the interactions of human and
natural systems when precisely those interactions were ushering in the
Anthropocene. If we only consider as cli-fi or Anthropocene fictions those
works that occur after the discovery of anthropogenic climate change we will
study only the literature responding to the effects of the crisis, thereby
overlooking perceptive narrative critiques of its causes (even though they did
not know what these causes were *of*). In other words, naturalist critiques of
twentieth-century social ecologies take on a new significance when we recognize
that they were writing at a critical moment in the environmental history of
America and the planet.

<!--defining naturalism-->This generic linkage may come as a surprise to many
critics of naturalism and speculative fiction alike, because naturalism's
relevance to ecocriticism and its habit of speculation have both been
understudied. When the generic term was coined, "naturalism" usually referred
to a common cluster of authors---Jack London, Theodore Dreiser, Frank Norris,
and Stephen Crane---and critics frequently juxtaposed its focus on characters
operating within a system of deterministic forces with realism's focus on
character, interiority, and individual agency [@mitchell_determined_1989 xii].
Since studies of the genre began, it has become notorious for the proliferation
of attempts to define it, which, while rarely contradicting each other
directly, just as rarely find easy consensus. Vernon Louis Parrington
associates it strongly with realism, only marked by a greater degree of
"pessimism" and a focus on characters less affluent than the average realist's
characters [qtd. in @applegate_american_2002 xviii]. Others, like Lee Clark
Mitchell and Donald Pizer, find a more philosophical basis for the definition
of the genre, emphasizing its investigation of deterministic principles and
considering how this investigation influences its class politics
[@mitchell_determined_1989 xii-xv, @applegate_american_2002 xviii-xx]. Most
critics accept the presence of deterministic forces and a preoccupation with
evolutionary theory as an explanation for human behavior as defining factors.
Building on work from across the spectrum of these definitions, this study will
consider as relevant to the naturalist discussion any American novels from
about 1890 through the Second World War that engage in some manner with
contemporary scientific and evolutionary theory to describe human behavior,
emphasize external events and physical conditions over individual agency as the
determinants of plot and narrative, and pose a "serious confrontation with the
meanings of "nature"'s changing status in the modern world"
[@fleissner_women_2004 7]. 

<!--new naturalisms-->Nascent discussions of naturalism's purview and legacy,
however, are beginning to attend to the continuum of speculative fiction and
naturalist fiction, with one recent article defining Richard Jeffries's *After
London* as a form of "speculative naturalism" [@plotz_speculative_2015] and
a recent special issue of *Studies in American Naturalism* devoted to exploring
the two genres' shared commitments. But while these existing studies provide
support for a consideration of naturalism and SF together, none explore the way
that speculation is used to further naturalism's proto-environmentalist
commitments. <!--parameters of my project-->I will explore this link in, first,
the works of several major naturalist authors, tracing environmental
speculation from the explicitly imagined worlds of Jack London in *The Scarlet
Plague* and *The Iron Heel* to the more subtle acts of global, ecological, and
systemic thinking in Frank Norris's *The Octopus* and *The Pit*. To define the
relationship in full, though, older purviews of literary naturalism that limit
themselves to likes of London and Norris exclusively will have to be set aside
in favor of more recent ones, like those of Jennifer Fleissner in *Women,
Compulsion, and Modernity* and [ x author in y work ], that have included women
and authors of color erroneously left out of the naturalist conversation.
Charlotte Perkins Gilman's ecotopian naturalist novel *Herland*, for example,
is often cited as a work of proto-speculative fiction, but it also tests the
limits of the naturalist understanding of environmental determinism, especially
in the context of the socialism that Gilman and many other naturalists share.
Charles W. Chesnutt has begun to appear in the naturalist orbit, largely
because he tests some of the genre's philosophical underpinnings by working
through a conception of environmental embeddedness outside of (and while
putting pressure on) the scientism characteristic of naturalism's "mainstream".
The purview of this dissertation encompasses authors from the old and new
schools of naturalism studies alike, but the environmentalism of the former
comes into a clearer light with the addition of the latter into the fold.

### Chapter I: The Farm at the End of the World: Jack London and the End of Capitalist Natures

The first chapter will consider the critique of "capitalist natures" inherent
in the post-apocalyptic novel, showing that it has its roots in American
literary naturalism's generic history and philosophical underpinnings. Among
the first disaster novels on the scale of the human species is Jack London's
*The Scarlet Plague* (1912), a speculative novel imagining the near-destruction
of humanity by a quick-acting and fatal epidemic. It is, for London,
a limit-case to test a theme developed throughout his collected work. Reading
short stories such as a "To Build a Fire" and agrarian novels such as *Burning
Daylight*, I will trace the development of the idea that human combination and
specialization under capitalism replace a more fundamental species-being[^ This
is a Marxist phrase that I am appropriating...] and survival capacity by
alienating the individual human from a defining, direct relationship to its
environment. Providing for oneself through direct interaction with the land is
deeply important to being human in London's eyes, but in an urbanizing world,
doing so becomes less necessary or even possible. 

In *Burning Daylight*, for example, the alienation process is traced through
the titular character's lost connection with the Yukon as he moves into the
financial world of urban life and futures speculation. Through Daylight's
struggles, London argues that escaping the system of capitalism and exchange is
the only way to regain this connection with the environment and, therefore,
with one's own species-being. Of course, as Fredric Jameson tells us, "it is
easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism." *The
Scarlet Plague*, two years and two novels later, imagines the end of the world
*in order to* imagine the end of capitalism, picking up the thread of *Burning
Daylight* to imagine what a post-civilization reversion to species-being and
a direct relation to environment might actually look like. But not all
post-capitalism is post-civilization: in the context of London's other major
speculative work, *The Iron Heel* (1908), *The Scarlet Plague* can be seen as
a depiction of what will happen if capitalist expansion is allowed to
inevitably collapse upon itself instead of being superceded by socialism,
a demonstration of the essence that needs to be regained as well as the
primitivism and cruelty that must not be. A more direct expression of
species-being may result for the human and for the rest of the formerly
dominated world ecology, but the human also returns to the food chain and to
competition with other life, a type of ecological embeddedness that is
unacceptable to London's essentially anthropocentric view of the
human-environment relationship. London's speculative turn is finally an
ecological one, then, because he uses the post-Apocalyptic scenario to imagine
the human as an organism among organisms, stripped of what it has made through
combination and civilization.

The rest of the chapter will consider the development of this thread of
argument in an ecology-focused strand of the genre through the present day. The
genre remains interested in considering the species as an object of
improvement-through-ecological-embeddedness---unlike London's founding example,
in which being one species among many constitutes a tragedy in itself.
Near-Apocalypse becomes an occasion to rebuild the species in a more harmonious
mold. Arguably the most influential work in the post-apocalyptic genre, George
R. Stewart's *Earth Abides* (1948), is also one of the most explicitly
ecological in its thinking, extending London's premise with a more nuanced and
realistic view of non-human nature.[^A Professor of English at UC Berkeley who
was at least familiar with London's work, it seems likely that Stewart would
have been familiar with *The Scarlet Plague*, and similarities abound.] In
establishing the genre proper, Stewart uses echoes of literary naturalism to
create an ecological legacy for disaster fiction. Octavia Butler conceives of
cultural disaster and cultural rebuilding in the place of physical tragedy,
using ecological consciousness as the centerpiece of cultural reinvention.
Finally, Atwood's *MadAddam Trilogy* juxtaposes cultural and Promethean forms
of rebuilding, turning the ecological reinvention of the human into both the
disaster and the means of recovery from it.

### Chapter II: Garden Industries: Naturalism and Ecotopia

The latter bounds of the post-apocalyptic genre emphasize rebuilding, *fixing*
the fundamental contradictions of the moment in which they are written---a
strange convention for a genre defined by acts of total destruction. The second
chapter will consider these reconstructive and reparative impulses directly,
demonstrating that the naturalist philosophy of environmental determinism was
extended to form an "ecotopian" paradigm of coevolution between a human society
and the ecology in which it is embedded---a concept of symbiotic
codetermination that complicates the unidirectional determinism that some
critics of naturalism have argued for. I will consider Charlotte Perkins
Gilman's *Herland* (1915) as the founding, naturalist text of the ecotopian
subgenre, comparing it with Ernest Callenbach's *Ecotopia* (1975) and Kim
Stanley Robinson's ecotopian works (*The Mars Trilogy* and *Aurora*
especially). 

Some common features define ecotopianism across the stages of its development.
Both imagine social and physical structures that resolve the perceived
environmental crises of the moment. Their resolutions are both defined by
improving a system's efficiency and elegance rather than expanding the system's
scale, a direct rejoinder to growth-based capitalism that is enforced by strict
geographic or political boundaries making growth impossible. As a result, both
works use a combination of "degrowth" and steady-state systems to
simultaneously resolve social and environmental contradictions. And finally, an
ecotopian text forces human systems into complex interchange and codependence
with the organisms of their environment, but imagines ways in which doing so
can lead to the mutual flourishing of all species involved. All of these
characteristics, however, arise in complex relation to the naturalist fantasy
of determination. While in the classic naturalist text, the collection of
"forces" is so overwhelming as to make individual or collective resistance
impossible,[^ln-resistance-futile] this utopian strain of naturalism imagines
that by altering the physical and economic structures of a society the path of
determination can be managed. This vision of managed codetermination, I will
argue, is a result of the ecotopian text's commitment to ecological management
as a way of relating to non-human nature. I will compare this tendency in three
historical moments to show how ecotopianism changes in response to shifting
views of environmental crises: the naturalist moment (1915, *Herland*), in
which the perceived tragedy is overproduction; the consumerist moment (1975,
*Ecotopia*), in which overconsumption predominates; and the neoliberal moment
(1993-1996, *The Mars Trilogy*), in which the conflict between scientism,
capitalism, and conservationism poses ecological management as a site of
contested utopian impulses. I will ultimately suggest that attending to the
ecotopian desires articulated across several historical moments can contribute
to the historical understanding of U.S. environmentalism beyond articulated
movements and institutional history.


### Chapter III: Nature without Science: Epistemological Resistance and Generic Marginalization

My third chapter will consider the possibility of non-scientific epistemologies
in the purview of naturalism and SF, arguing that limiting the definition of
naturalism to texts that enthusiastically accept Darwinism and SF to texts that
commit to the scientific method would leave out important contributions to both
genres. The naturalist concept of environmental determinism, for example, can
and does exist outside of a scientific context. Juxtaposing scientific and
non-scientific versions of environmental determinism in a naturalist context,
we can test the limits of some of the genre's fundamental philosophical
premises when they are applied beyond its "traditional" purview (whose authors
are overwhelmingly white, are often either Northeastern or Western, and could
be accused of scientism). 

This chapter's central texts will be "The Goophered Grapevine" and "Po' Sandy"
from Charles W. Chesnutt's *The Conjure Woman, and Other Conjure Tales* (1899);
although Chesnutt is often read as a realist, he has been included in some
discussions of naturalism[^ln-chesnutt-naturalist] that are attempting to
expand the field, and he meets the criteria of a naturalist text I define
above. The stories pose a direct confrontation of epistemologies when
a Northern agriculturalist moves south to turn a former plantation into
a vineyard, and in the process encounters an understanding of ecological
embeddedness based in conjuration and hoodoo. Chesnutt puts hoodoo-based
environmental determinism as a direct challenge to the agriculturalist's
rationalist epistemology through the vehicle of the Northerner's skepticism:
each story is presented as fact by Julius McAdoo, a former slave and narrator
of the tales of conjuration, but doubted by its recipients and Julius is given
a motive for making each story up. Leaving the stories veracity unresolvable
calls into question the types of knowledge practiced in the story's teller, but
also its doubter. He represents the discord between the two groups as primarily
over what counts as environmental knowledge as it intersects with conflicting
plans for land use. In "The Goophered Grapevine," the fate of the plants,
inhabitants of the vineyard, and agricultural schemes involving either depend
on the existence of a goopher placed on the land years ago, and therefore on
the ability of individual humans to be fully embedded in their immediate
environment. In "Po' Sandy," a slave's "escape" by becoming a tree is set
alongside Julius's (possible) attempt to reserve a space for a black religious
group as parallel forms of resistance. Chesnutt's speculative act is therefore
not focused on the future of the environment itself, as in some of this study's
other core texts; rather, he creates a conflict of forms of knowledge to
consider how conflicting conceptions of nature will coincide with land-use
conflicts  in the post-Reconstruction South. The debate over the changing
status of nature---to paraphrase Fleissner's definition of naturalism---is only
made possible by the irreconcilable conflict of these forms of knowledge. 

Chesnutt's example will serve as a jumping-off point to consider how a doctrine
of scientific, and especially explicitly Darwinian, understanding of nature has
been used to marginalize the naturalist and SF works of indigenous peoples and
people of color in much the same way that the process has occurred in
environmentalism more broadly. Building on the work of environmental justice
scholars such as Carolyn Finney and Joan Martinez-Alier, I will consider how
environmental speculation can be used to foreground the very epistemological
conflicts that have informed conservative definitions of both naturalism and
speculative fiction.


### Chapter IV: The Intergalactic Spatial Fix: Planetarity, Scale, and World(s) Systems

My final chapter will examine the role of the global imagination in naturalist
environmental speculation, taking as its central text Frank Norris's unfinished
*Epic of the Wheat* (*The Octopus*, *The Pit*, and the never-started *The
Wolf*) to ask how the rise of the global economy gives rise to speculation as
a mode of thinking about the planet ecologically. In Norris's case, the
semi-mystical, semi-sentient character of "The Wheat" is a narrative mechanism
that makes it possible to depict the world ecology,[^ln-world-ecology] an
intersection of economic and ecological forces on a global scale. In *The
Octopus*, The Wheat uses a complex juxtaposition of narrative scales, in which
local events and struggles are motivated by global resource networks, to
compare the effects of economic and ecological "forces" on human lives. Though
the action is centered in the San Joaquin Valley in California, the motivating
events are all driven by the changing price of wheat according to global
distribution schemes. At the same time, the novel goes out of its way to
examine several different farming techniques as they interact with these global
markets---from sustainable crop rotations to more exploitative methods that are
compared to mining. The result is that the novel's global sense of resource
markets has visible effects on local ecologies. In *The Pit*, Norris
articulates the means by which these markets are manipulated while showing the
extent to which commodity futures dematerialize the commodity itself---thereby
allowing for unlimited exploitation. Across the two novels, The Wheat becomes
a mechanism used to depict the dangers this ignorance of the ecological effects
of a global market: it embodies natural limitations itself, the very
limitations that markets attempt always to exceed.

I will attempt to position this strain of naturalist thought as a precursor to
David Harvey's concept of the "spatial fix" and the recent conversation around
the "world ecology" among [] and others. In emphasizing the spatial limitations
of the planet, Norris echoes Harvey's theory that capital maintains itself by
opening new areas of the globe as markets, but that it is an inherently
unsustainable strategy; London follows suit to an even greater extent in *The
Iron Heel*, in which his protagonist makes a case for a socialist revolution
based on very similar principles. Similarly, the attempt to incorporate local
ecological change and global market behavior into a single theory anticipates
the concept of the "world ecology," which is based on very similar principles.

I will conclude by showing how all of this world-ecological thinking leads
directly to narratives of terraformation, represented primarily (but not
exclusively) by Kim Stanley Robinson's *Mars Trilogy*---a trilogy to which
world systems theory is certainly relevant, as Robinson would have studied it
under his graduate advisor Fredric Jameson. I will argue that terraformation
narratives arise as a response to the crisis fears inherent in world-ecological
thought, and that the narrative strategies used to depict vastly different
scales persist from literary naturalism to contemporary speculative fiction.
