<!--Relevance of cli-fi-->Cli-fi, or "climate fiction," is becoming a strong
contender as the literature of the twenty-first century. It deals directly with
climate change, which looks to be the century's defining (if non-discrete)
event; in its inherent speculativeness it mirrors the rate of technological and
ecological change so characteristic of the age; and it is a development of
speculative fiction, a genre that may have been born in the nineteenth century,
but came of age and reputability in the twentieth. The genre has seen a much
more enthusiastic reception than its predecessor. Its path somewhat cleared by
the emergence of Anthropocene studies more generally, cli-fi has found an
academic reception commensurable with its retail success. While much of the
early discussion of the genre took place in commercial and trade publications,
including *Kirkus*, *The Guardian*, and *The New Yorker*,[^ln-journo] in 2015
several academic books were released on the topic,[^ln-academic-clifi] with
more likely to come, and a cursory search for syllabi with the keywords
"climate change" or "Anthropocene" yields many hits.

<!--environmental sf beyond/before cli-fi -->Before there was cli-fi, there was
a longstanding vein of significant environmentalist thought in speculative
fiction, most notoriously in Frank Herbert's *Dune* (1965) and running through
the modern era in Kim Stanley Robinson's works of the 1980s and '90s. In fact,
the term "cli-fi" often indicates less an explicit concern with climatological
issues specifically as a recent entry in this longstanding tradition in
speculative fiction, but now understood through the lens of a single
overwhelming environmental issue. Cli-fi, in these terms, far predates human
consciousness of anthropogenic climate change and the Anthropocene. More
probably, it arises contemporaneously with one of the defining events of the
Anthropocene itself, the Second Industrial Revolution. 
 
<!--Statement of argument: literary naturalism is the predecessor of cli-fi,
but its own form of environmental speculation is understudied-->But the
literary and philosophical genealogy of the genre is more complex than it
appears, even with this expanded definition, and requires a discussion of
another genre entirely. The roots of the cli-fi's environmental speculation can
be found in the tradition of American literary naturalism. My dissertation will
discuss environmental speculation in American literary naturalism (henceforth
"naturalism") both as a mode of proto-environmentalist thinking and as
a precursor to the environmentalist line of speculative fiction that would
develop over the rest of the century. I will use mainlines of environmentalist
discussion in speculative fiction as starting points to show how the concepts
first emerged in literary naturalism, elaborating their logics in the original
context before showing how they developed into the forms they would eventually
take as cli-fi. [make the case in brief?]

<!--defining naturalism-->When the generic term was coined, "naturalism"
usually referred to a common cluster of authors---Jack London, Theodore
Dreiser, Frank Norris, and Stephen Crane---and critics frequently juxtaposed
its focus on the lower echelons of society operating within a system of
deterministic forces and events with Realism's focus on character, interiority,
and individual agency [@mitchell_determined_1989 xii]. Since studies of the
genre began, it has become notorious for the proliferation of attempts to
define it, which, while rarely contradicting each other, just as rarely find
easy consensus.[^ This state of affairs that causes some critics to attempt to
"avoid that debate entirely" [@michaels_gold_1987 26]] Building on recent,
broader discussions of naturalism, this study will consider as naturalist any
American novels from about 1890 through the Second World War that engage with
contemporary scientific theory (especially evolutionary theory) to describe
human behavior, emphasize external events and physical conditions over
individual agency as the determinants of plot and narrative, and pose
a "serious confrontation with the meanings of "nature"'s changing status in the
modern world" [@fleissner_women_2004 7]. 

[ make the case sans texts; define it in my terms, lean heavily on
environmental determinism (link it with ecological embeddedness); also a kind
of historical literature from below; dismiss plot of decline? Or "save that for
the novel"... ]

...from the explicitly imagined worlds of Jack London in *The Scarlet Plague*
and *The Iron Heel* to the more subtle acts of global, ecological, and systemic
thinking in Frank Norris's *The Octopus* and *The Pit*. To define the
relationship in full, though, older purviews of literary naturalism that limit
themselves to likes of London and Norris exclusively will have to be set aside
in favor of more recent ones, like those of Jennifer Fleissner in *Women,
Compulsion, and Modernity* and [ x author in y work ], that have included women
and authors of color erroneously left out of the naturalist conversation.
Charlotte Perkins Gilman's ecotopian naturalist novel *Herland*, for example,
is often cited as a work of proto-speculative fiction, but it also tests the
limits of the naturalist understanding of environmental determinism. Charles W.
Chesnutt has begun to appear in the naturalist orbit, largely because he tests
some of the genre's philosophical underpinnings by working through a conception
of environmental embeddedness outside of (and while putting pressure on) the
scientism characteristic of naturalism's "mainstream". The purview of this
dissertation encompasses authors from the old and new schools of naturalism
studies alike, but the environmentalism of the former comes into a clearer
light with the addition of the latter into the fold.

The first chapter will consider the critique of "capitalist natures" inherent
in the post-apocalyptic novel, showing that it has its roots in American
literary naturalism's generic history and philosophical underpinnings. Among
the first disaster novels on the scale of the human species is Jack London's
*The Scarlet Plague* (1912), a speculative novel imagining the near-destruction
of humanity by a quick-acting and fatal epidemic. It is, for London,
a limit-case to test a theme developed throughout his collected work. Reading
short stories such as a "To Build a Fire" and agrarian novels such as *Burning
Daylight*, I will trace the development of the idea that human combination and
specialization under capitalism replace a more fundamental species-being[^ This
is a Marxist phrase that I am appropriating...] and survival capacity by
alienating the individual human from a defining, direct relationship to its
environment. Providing for oneself through direct interaction with the land is
deeply important to being human in London's eyes, but in an urbanizing world,
doing so becomes less necessary or even possible. 

In *Burning Daylight*, for example, the alienation process is traced through
the titular character's lost connection with the Yukon as he moves into the
financial world of urban life and futures speculation. Through Daylight's
struggles, London argues that escaping the system of capitalism and exchange is
the only way to regain this connection with the environment and, therefore,
with one's own species-being. Of course, as Fredric Jameson tells us, "it is
easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism." *The
Scarlet Plague*, two years and two novels later, imagines the end of the world
*in order to* imagine the end of capitalism, picking up the thread of *Burning
Daylight* to imagine what a post-civilization reversion to species-being and
a direct relation to environment might actually look like. But not all
post-capitalism is post-civilization: in the context of London's other major
speculative work, *The Iron Heel* (1908), *The Scarlet Plague* can be seen as
a depiction of what will happen if capitalist expansion is allowed to
inevitably collapse upon itself instead of being superceded by socialism,
a demonstration of the essence that needs to be regained as well as the
primitivism and cruelty that must not be. A more direct expression of
species-being may result for the human and for the rest of the formerly
dominated world ecology, but the human also returns to the food chain and to
competition with other life, a type of ecological embeddedness that is
unacceptable to London's essentially anthropocentric view of the
human-environment relationship. London's speculative turn is finally an
ecological one, then, because he uses the post-Apocalyptic scenario to imagine
the human as an organism among organisms, stripped of what it has made through
combination and civilization.

The rest of the chapter will consider the development of this thread of
argument in an ecology-focused strand of the genre through the present day. The
genre remains interested in considering the species as an object of
improvement-through-ecological-embeddedness---unlike London's founding example,
in which being one species among many constitutes a tragedy in itself.
Near-Apocalypse becomes an occasion to rebuild the species in a more harmonious
mold. Arguably the most influential work in the post-apocalyptic genre, George
R. Stewart's *Earth Abides* (1948), is also one of the most explicitly
ecological in its thinking, extending London's premise with a more nuanced and
realistic view of non-human nature.[^A Professor of English at UC Berkeley who
was at least familiar with London's work, it seems likely that Stewart would
have been familiar with *The Scarlet Plague*, and similarities abound.] In
establishing the genre proper, Stewart uses echoes of literary naturalism to
create an ecological legacy for disaster fiction. Octavia Butler conceives of
a cultural disaster and cultural rebuilding in the place of physical tragedies,
using ecological consciousness as the centerpiece of cultural reinvention.
Finally, Atwood's *MadAddam Trilogy* juxtaposes cultural and Promethean forms
of rebuilding, turning the ecological reinvention of the human into both the
disaster and the means of recovery from it.

The latter bounds of the post-apocalyptic genre emphasize rebuilding, *fixing*
the fundamental contradictions of the moment in which they are written---a
strange convention for a genre based on massive acts of destruction. The second
chapter will consider these reconstructive and reparative impulses directly,
asking how the utopian aspects of environmental speculation counterbalance its
tendency to emphasize catastrophe. Developing this apparent contradiction into
a theory of "ecotopian naturalism," I will consider Charlotte Perkins Gilman's
*Herland* (1915) as the founding text of the ecotopian subgenre, comparing it
with the work half a century later that introduced the term as a fictional
conceit, Ernest Callenbach's *Ecotopia* (1975). Some common features define the
ecotopianism of both works. Both imagine social and physical structures that
resolve the perceived environmental crises of the moment. Their resolutions are
both defined by improving a system's efficiency and elegance rather than
expanding the system's scale, a direct response to growth-based capitalism that
is enforced by strict geographic or political boundaries making growth
impossible. As a result, both works use a combination of "degrowth" and
steady-state systems to simultaneously resolve social and environmental
contradictions. And finally, an ecotopian text forces human systems into
complex interchange and codependence with the organisms of their environment,
but imagines ways in which doing so can lead to the mutual flourishing of all
species involved.
