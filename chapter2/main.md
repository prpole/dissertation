> For my fear is the fear of long ago, the fear that was rampant in the Younger
World, and in the youth of the Younger World. In short, the fear that reigned
supreme in that period known as the Mid-Pleistocene. (1)

Jack London's *Before Adam* (year) begins with an act of geological
periodization. But the object of this periodization is not a stratigraphic
record, the layers of mineral sedimentation that make up the inorganic archive
of the planet. The archive here is the periodizing consciousness itself, having
gained access to the accreted layers of memory that make up its identity---an
identity that in turn encompasses far more than a sum of individual
experiences.

Jack London's geology, in short, is a geology of the human, a geology in which
the human is both the subject and object of study. A century later, we have
a name for this geology: the Anthropocene.

Of course, though technically only designating a geological epoch defined by
the influence of collective human activity, the term "Anthropocene" has always
indicated much more than a geological consideration of the human. Even in some
of the earliest uses of the term, it had already come to indicate anthropogenic
destruction of the planet through means as diverse as carbon emissions,
deforestation, population growth, and animal domestication
[@crutzen_geology_2002, @crutzen_"anthropocene"_2006]. Considering the "human
species" as a universalizing concept is both an explanation of this destruction
and a response to it. According to Dipesh Chakrabarty, in his seminal essay
"The Climate of History: Four Theses," "Species may indeed be the name of
a placeholder for an emergent, new universal history of humans that flashes up
in the moment of the danger that is climate change" [-@chakrabarty_climate_2009
221]. On one hand, beholding the scale of the destruction wrought by
a collective that exceeds every individual while comprising them forces us to
think collectively in ways that the species concept uniquely enables. But on
the other hand, it is the threat of self-inflicted mass extinction that causes
us to think about what is being threatened, to place ourselves in the long
history of lifeforms coming into being and disappearing in a geological moment.

This also describes the conditions under which the species concept emerges in
London's work, as well as the philosophical narrative uses he puts it to. [...]

This chapter will explore the ways in which literary naturalism, and
particularly the works of Jack London, has already taken up one of the chief
heuristic challenges posed by the Anthropocene as a theoretical discourse: to
consider the place of natural history in human history by conceiving of the
human *as a species*.
