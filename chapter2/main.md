### Introduction

Jack London's 1906 novel *Before Adam* is perhaps the most overt entry in
a career-spanning attempt to narrate *species as such*. The unnamed narrator
tells us that since he was a child, his sleep has been marked by dreams that
come from the scattered memory of a distant, pre-human progenitor, which he
reconstructs in language that his ancestor could never have understood (being
pre-lingual). This ancestor, Big-Tooth, is a member of a tribe the narrator
dubs the "The Folk", who contend for survival with natural predators, atavistic
brutes who retain the characteristics of even older species, and the
technologically advanced race of "Fire People"---a battle the The Folk
ultimately lose, becoming extinct except for the half-Fire Person progeny of
Big-Tooth. Originally serialized, the novel is picaresque, its somewhat shallow
narrative serving as a vehicle to imaginatively enter a consciousness that is
on its way to becoming human, observing as it tries and fails to develop the
language and technology needed to resist the designs of the Fire People. The
story these episodes do form as a whole, however, is one that, to London, is of
great significance: it stands in for the myriad contests between pre-human
primates that determined the nature of the modern human.<!--something's not
working here-->

Before this conceit is fully established, however, London performs a peculiar
act of geological periodization. The object of this periodization is not
a stratigraphic record, the layers of mineral sedimentation that make up the
inorganic archive of the planet. Rather, the experiences and memories of the
narrator himself are dated on a geologic timescale:

> In my days only did I attain any measure of happiness. My nights marked the
reign of fear---and such fear!...[M]y fear is the fear of long ago, the fear
that was rampant in the Younger World, and in the youth of the Younger World.
In short, the fear that reigned supreme in that period known as the
Mid-Pleistocene. (1)

We are asked, from the beginning, to understand this man's experience in
terms well beyond the boundaries of his own life, or even the lives of several
generations. We are instead asked to place his visceral fear in a context that
defies the capacities of individual experience---told that in order to
understand it, we have to not only think but feel, as he is forced to, across
the temporal poles that define the ambit of the human species as a whole. The
site of London's geological archive becomes the periodizing consciousness
itself, which has gained access to the accreted layers of memory that make up
its identity---an identity that in turn encompasses far more than a sum of
individual experiences. 

Jack London's geology, in short, is a geology of the human, a geology in which
the human is both the subject and object of study. A century later, we have
a name for this geology: the Anthropocene. This chapter will explore the ways
Jack London uses the narrative techniques of naturalism to construct an
experience of species as a lived identity, focusing particularly on his short
story "To Build a Fire" (1908) and his late agricultural novels, *Burning
Daylight* (1913) and *The Valley of the Moon* (1915). This exploration will
ultimately suggest that London had preemptively taken up one of the chief
heuristic challenges posed by the Anthropocene as a theoretical discourse
almost a century before that discourse began: to consider the place of natural
history in human history (and vice versa) by expanding the temporal scope of
what constitutes "human history", rendering the human species itself as an
identity that is able to be experienced as such, and using this experience of
species as a way to understand the role of the human in the long history of the
planet. In pursuing this argument, I will consider the ways that London's well
known use of non-human perspectives lets him come to terms with the human
identity from without, but I will also confront the difficulty of separating
London's confused perspectives on race with his attempts to think through
species as a defining category. Finally, I will show that London takes the
narration of species-as-such that he developed over the course of the first
decade of the twentieth century and extends it to an analysis of the
detrimental influence of human activity on the planet in his late agricultural
novels (and in his life on the experimental ranch that inspired them). In
short, an understanding of the human based on a geological timescale is a basis
for London's understanding of the causes of extensive environmental destruction
as well as potential responses to it.

And yet, thinking the human geologically as London does has until recently
constituted a category error. The human is mere biology, and we had thus (until
the discovery of the Anthropocene) been assumed to interact with other
lifeforms and our immediate environment without so much as scratching the
surface of the geological record. What the designation of the Anthropocene
recognizes, however, is that despite being barely more than the period at the
end of the vast history of the planet, the human has now ascended to the scale
of a geological force that could well define that planet's future, leaving many
and various marks in the stratigraphic record as we unwittingly alter the
function of the most basic systems of the natural
environment.[^ln-stratigraphy] Attempts to confront the Anthropocene, whether
conceptually or practically, have found in this most basic premise
a considerable stumbling block because of its reliance on an uncomplicated
universal "human". To act in recognition that the human collective has become
a geological force, one has to first experience oneself as fundamentally part
of that human collective---not even biologically or geologically, but as part
of an identity that precedes and exceeds the intellect and the individual.
Whether this is possible has been a matter of some debate, but such an
experience is precisely what many of the narrative techniques of literary
naturalism, and Jack London's work in particular, attempt to induce.

[^ln-stratigraphy]: I'll summarize the findings of the Anthropocene Working
Group of the Stratigraphers Union here---basically, subject to fact checking:
The stratigraphic record, or the accretion of various geological events that
are legible in the mineral deposits of the Earth, is used to determine epochs
and such. The Anthropocene working group found a number of possible candidates
for the "golden spike" in the stratigraphic record that could be used as the
official starting point for the Anthropocene, including things as various as
scars from the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the ubiquitous deposits of
chicken bones that have resulted from widespread industrial agriculture.

<!--s-b-->London was not the first and would not be the last to pursue an
understanding of the species concept on this basis. Before him, [?] Feuerbach
coined the term "species-being" in an attempt to define the essential
characteristics and activities that unite members of a species; Karl Marx in
turn would take up in Feuerbach's concept in the early formulations of his
theory of alienation to show just what was at stake in the industrialization of
labor. With the heuristic challenges posed by the "Anthropos" of Anthropocene,
species-being as a concept has reemerged with a new resonance, now making it
possible to question what role humanness-as-such plays in the environmental
crisis.[^ln-sb-reemergence] Invoking species-being here, then, can serve to put
London at once in the context of the Marxist theory that was central to his own
thinking on a number of topics throughout his life[^ln-london-marxism] and the
Anthropocene discourse he partially predicts. 

But the term is a useful one on its own merits, engaging species with
a perspective similar to London's. As I will show in more detail, the concept
of species-being and London's narration of species both assert a degree of
mutual experience and subjectivity across members of a species without taking
that mutuality as totally deterministic of an individual's nature.
Species-being is therefore non-essentialist in reference to the individual, and
at least in Marx's version of the term, also historically. Marx's version of
human species-being is largely defined by conscious production, and as such,
changes in the social and technological means of production lead to
corresponding changes in the nature of the human. London similarly describes
transformations in human species-being according to a combination of
individuality and changing socio-technological conditions, taking the
Promethean symbol of fire as an emblem of humanness and urban environments as
sites of catastrophic alienation from self and species alike. Insofar as human
species-being itself is responsible for the existential threat to the planet,
it will not be due to some immutable essence, but rather as a result of a
historically contingent development of the abilities and characteristics that
define us.

[^ln-sb-reemergence]: To my knowledge, none of these recent engagements with
the term attempt a systematic rehashing of the term, but primarily use it to
invoke the actions of the human species in general or better understand the way
species as a concept features in the thinking of other authors or theorists
(nor does the present chapter claim to present such a systematic approach).

[^ln-london-marxism]: 

As an historically contingent essence, species-being thus adopts many of the
common targets of environmentalist critique as defining aspects of what it
means to be human---or to be more precise, what it has meant to be human at
given moments in an extremely long-durée historical trajectory. But the ability
to conceive of these critiques in terms of the species itself is the first step
in any suitable response to the crisis that is implied by and that gave rise to
the term "Anthropocene". Though technically only designating a geological epoch
defined by the influence of collective human activity, the Anthropocene has
always meant more than a passive marker of a temporal boundary. Even in some of
the earliest uses of the term, it had already come to indicate anthropogenic
destruction of the planet through means as diverse as carbon emission,
deforestation, population growth, and animal domestication as well as the need
for immediate remediation [@crutzen_geology_2002,
@crutzen_"anthropocene"_2006]. Reviving the "human species" as a universalizing
concept is both an explanation of this destruction and a response to it.
Indeed, as Dipesh Chakrabarty puts it in his seminal essay "The Climate of
History: Four Theses," "Species may indeed be the name of a placeholder for an
emergent, new universal history of humans that flashes up in the moment of the
danger that is climate change" [-@chakrabarty_climate_2009 221]. If our "moment
of danger" is causing us to reach for the species concept, a biological
collective that both exceeds and composes the individual, it is in response to
a dual relationship to mass extinction. We recognize that the human collective
has become a destructive force by its very nature, but we recognize at the same
time that this destructiveness does not come with omnipotence. To think of the
human in a superhuman timescale is to take seriously the threat of
self-inflicted mass extinction, to place ourselves in the long history of
lifeforms coming into being and disappearing in a geological moment. 

*Before Adam* ends on this same note of ephemerality---a simultaneous
ephemerality of individual and species. The Folk, after all, do not survive to
become human. Though we don't know their fate for certain, it is clear that
they are so diminished as to form barely a hereditary trace in the makeup of
the modern human compared to the dominant Fire People, a mere eddy in the gene
pool. Reflecting on the moment when the few surviving Folk assemble after being
routed by the Fire People, the narrator says, "It is like the meeting of the
handful of survivors after the day of the end of the world."[@... 235] As he
would again in 1912's *The Scarlet Plague*, a post-apocalyptic novel in which
a plague wipes out all but a small community of survivors who revert to
primitive ways of living, London invokes the end of the world as an occasion to
consider the fragility of humanity as a whole.

For London and contemporary thinkers of the Anthropocene alike, ephemerality
also leads to a more poignant experience of a species identity. In this moment
of threat, the narrator, speaking for Big-Tooth, subtly changes his focus from
the limited perspective of Big-Tooth's own experiences to the fortunes of the
collective, speaking for both Big-Tooth and the species he represents. The
usual subject "I" becomes a "we" as The Folk are hounded to the edges of
habitable land to the sea. "We could not survive in such an environment," he
says, and "the radical change in our diet was not good for us...[w]e were all
lean and dyspeptic-looking." Drawing attention to the effects of a changed
environment on The Folk, the narrator also draws attention to the relatively
particular conditions required for a given (non-human) species to survive,
doing so by speaking for a species population that has become small enough to
be easily apprehensible. Speaking for a species is possible in conditions where
it is the same as speaking for a community. Births and deaths in this
species-community, for example, take on a new significance. When he says that
"we died faster than new ones were born" and "our number steadily diminished,"
it is understood to be an existential threat to the species as a whole. This
threat in turn leads to a meditation on the nature of the human itself: "I, the
modern, am incontestably a man," we are told; "yet I, Big-Tooth, the primitive,
am not a man. Somewhere, and by straight line of descent, these two parties to
my dual personality were connected. Were the Folk, before their destruction, in
the process of becoming men?...I do not know."[@... 241] Understanding the
species-identity of the pre-human "Folk" is possible in a way that, to the
narrator, the identity of the modern human simply is not. London provides the
possibility of a species experience in the Folk before creating a speculative
gap that invites meditation on the experience of modern humanity in the same
terms he sets out for the Folk.

He is not alone in this simultaneous acknowledgement of the need to think about
the human collective and hesitation to think about the human species in the
same way we think of non- or pre-human species. Though the human species is
a universal concept that, as Chakrabarty puts it, "flashes up" in an
existentially threatening moment, it inhabits a timescale that would seem to be
too far removed from that of human experience to be easily apprehensible---or,
for that matter, apprehensible at all in any experiential sense. It is
Chakrabarty himself who has most influentially voiced this impossibility: 

> Who is the we? We humans never experience ourselves as a species. We can only
intellectually comprehend or infer the existence of the human species but never
experience it as such. There could be no phenomenology of us as a species. Even
if we were to emotionally identify with a word like mankind, we would not know
what being a species is, for, in species history, humans are only an instance
of the concept species as indeed would be any other life form. But one never
experiences being a concept. (220)

We may be able to conceive of the totality, and we may be able to experience it
as a kind of guilt on behalf of that totality. But the phenomenological gap
between self and species is too large: species may be always already embodied,
but it is not able to be lived except conceptually, or intellectually. The
Anthropocene thus presents a moment of crisis in the individual imagination.
Thinking our new epoch requires that the individual experience be expanded even
further beyond the self than what normal historical consciousness requires,
a collectivizing act that is less identification with something larger than 
interrogation of an identity that is both *a priori* and embodied. 

Herein, of course, lies the great danger of species-thinking as a theoretical
program. It risks ignoring half a century of critical theory, the very basis of
which is opposition to the kind of essentialism a discourse of the human
species would seem to imply. At least in the humanities, a proliferation of
alternate terms has resulted, most notable among them being the Capitalocene,
the Androcene, and the Cthulucene. These searches for an alternative term have
one thing in common: they understand the "anthropos" in Anthropocene as an even
distribution of blame for actions the benefits of which have historically been
anything *but* even. <!--That Jack London invokes the species as a heuristic hardly
redeems it, and may in fact do the opposite. -->

But this understandably critical reaction to the term may well mistake one type
of universal for another, or at least apply to it a historiographic method that
searches for an ethical and economic accounting when the term's argument is
first and foremost about the capacities of an organism considered in
natural-historical terms. Ian Baucom, sharing the concerns that cause this
discomfort as he considers Chakrabarty's version of the universal species
concept, points out that the Anthropocene's universalism "seems to wreak havoc
on the key principles of historical understanding and political commitment that
have animated not only Chakrabarty's preceding body of work, but the broader
project of postcolonial critique to which that work has been dedicated"
[-@baucom_human_2012 3]. But to consider the species concept as a universal of
the same type as those that postcolonial critique has opposed in the past,
Baucom continues, would be to miss Chakrabarty's point. It is not
a universalism in the Hegelian mode<!--what does this mean? should figure out
and gloss since we don't get the whole Baucom-->, which Chakrabarty himself has
opposed in the name of a struggle for the "freedom of difference," but
a "natural--scientific" universalism that presents a new paradigm
entirely[@-baucom_human_2012 3]. As Baucom reads it, in this new paradigm
"freedom can no longer be conceived of as the freedom of difference against the
power of the globalizing same." Rather, because "freedom" now relies on
survival through a collective effort to save the planet by transforming our
relationship to it, this universal concept has become a requirement of freedom
itself. The pursuit of freedom is now "a task of the species, as species, for
the species. It is a universal human challenge, a challenge of humanity's
shared natural history and its shared planetary future" [-@baucom_human_2012
3]. Baucom shifts the universalizing gesture of the "anthropos" prefix onto the
deep past and the preservation of an equally deep future, careful to emphasize
temporalities that fall beyond the scope of historiographies on the human
scale. 

The problem of species, of the "*anthropos*" in the Anthropocene, is thus
manifold and entangled. It demands a natural-scientific universalism that takes
the species concept as the basis for human history and as the starting point in
the struggle for freedom. It requires an understanding of anthropogenic
planetary change based on this species history. But in developing such
a species history, we risk backsliding into the essentialisms of the past, and
thus a concerted effort must be made to differentiate a natural-scientific
universalism of collective survival from the universals of the past that have
long been used to justify programs of domination and exploitation. 

And yet over all these tasks hovers an enduring paradox: to address the
conceptual and practical challenges of the Anthropocene, we must embrace
a concept that Chakrabarty claims fundamentally exceeds the capacities of human
experience, that has no phenomenology, that is somehow both embodied and
inaccessible.

Though differently framed, the defining questions and formal characteristics of
literary naturalism speak directly to this set of concerns. In pursuing the
well-trodden ground of the "determinism" question in literary naturalism,
critics of the genre have debated the role of species characteristics in
determining the actions and experiences of the
individual.[^ln-determinism-species-examples] The naturalist character is,
famously or notoriously, less notable as an individual subjectivity than as
a nexus of warring deterministic forces. The most marked conflicts occur
between "forces" defined by evolutionary conditioning and those that are
a product of a physical and social environment, especially in the context of
urban environments.[ Norris examples? ] 

[^ln-determinism-species-examples]: some examples of naturalist criticism that
drives this home? Look at the classics: Pizer, Walcutt... "Determined Fictions"

Introducing the species concept into this discourse merely requires a reminder
that speciation is the product of evolutionary variation. But when this common
reading of the naturalist character is recast not just in terms of the species
concept, but in terms of the species concept with all the resonances it has
gained in the discourse of the Anthropocene, readings of the naturalist form
and its philosophical underpinnings alike gain added significance. In treating
characters as more than individual subjectivities, as typological figures and
as products of biological and environmental conditions instead, the narrative
strategies unique to naturalist fiction pursue the same imaginative capacities
that are required to conceive of the species in the ways Chakrabarty says is
both necessary and impossible. 

Most notably, despite their aspirations to narrate vast systems of human and
non-human "forces", naturalist novels tend to be insistently visceral in the
descriptive details they use to compose this narration. One need only think of
Dreiser's Carrie or Wharton's Lily Bart to see how the visceral and the
systemic intertwine. Both women experience the bodily changes that result from
their gruelling labor in clothes production, a process detailed in terms that
evoke the lived experience of the labor rather than the theory of it; and yet
for both authors, the experiential serves the conceptual, establishing a window
into the alienation of labor and the economic systems that lead to
it.[^ln-dreiser-wharton] 

[^ln-dreiser-wharton]: Definitely need to give the examples here... and there
is so much scholarship on this topic. 

While these are historical rather than natural-historical examples---the
conditions of labor are historically contingent and understandable within human
timescales---the same holds true of the natural historical cases. In *Before
Adam*, the narrator's access to the memories of his deep past comes from
feeling, not contemplation: from fear, a felt and decidedly unscientific
experience. To feel the fear of the Pleistocene epoch is to recall a distinctly
different humanity, one that has not superceded the bounds of biological agency
to become geological---indeed, one that has not yet removed itself from the
food chain or secured its sustenance through the soft conquest of agriculture
and animal domestication. The gulf between this pre-human form and the modern
human is underscored by juxtaposition of the Folk with the Fire People. When
Big-Tooth and his friend Lop-Ear stalk the Fire People and investigate the
remnants of their fire, the simplest possible moment of dramatic irony results:
"I wanted to see what [the fire] was like, and between thumb and finger,
I picked up a glowing coal. My cry of pain and fear, as I dropped it, stampeded
Lop-Ear into the trees, and his flight frightened me after him."[@... 165] This
moment of pain and fear, though minor, is reminiscent of the fears of the
"Mid-Pleistocene" in general that London narrates---fears that result not from
the external conditions themselves but from the Folk's inability to confront
them using the methods humanity has developed since, like technology and
community. In other words, the fear results from being someone like Big-Tooth,
who "did not bother to weigh and analyze," who "was simplicity itself" and
"just lived events, without ever pondering why he lived them in his particular
and often erratic way." [@... 137] In imagining not knowing that fire will
burn---or not knowing how to use weapons to fight predators, or not knowing to
band together to resist a larger enemy---the modern reader must imagine
a consciousness without the same type of problem-solving, tool-use, and social
capacities that so define human history. But the entry point to this
consciousness is the shared visceral feelings of pain and fear.

Imagining such a consciousness, in the context of London's entire body of work,
is more than a curiosity. To recall this earlier state of being
in the context of evolutionary history is to draw the outline of the human
species history through an experiential link between early and late temporal
poles. The result is not an abstract conception but a comparison of ways of
being that encompasses a multi-epochal humanness.

### Species-Being, Human and Animal

<!--outline dog books, nature fakers, to build a fire; must conclude long intro
by opening up the question of species-being per se--->

The part of London's work that is most relevant to the species discussion is
also the part for which he is most famous: the stories with canine
protagonists. In *The Call of the Wild* (1903) and *White Fang* (1906), two
dogs explore the line between domesticity and wildness. In the former, Buck
becomes progressively wilder as he moves from a comfortable existence on a farm
to leading a sled team to running free with a pack of wolves. The latter
presents an inverse situation, tracing White Fang's life from his birth in the
wilderness through his coming of age in captivity, where he is forced into the
dog fighting ring until being rescued and finally domesticated. Here and
elsewhere, London uses the individual dog character to explore the subjective
experience of species. On one hand, he considers the degree to which the
experience of a single dog is the result of dogness---that is, to what extent
species itself can be said to account for individual subjectivity. On the other
hand, he uses the dog figure as a vantage point from which to consider the
human, and to ask whether humanness can be used to define the individual person
in the same way that dogness can define the individual dog. 

Even where his conclusions were limited to actual dogs, interrogating species
as such made trouble for London in what is now known as the "nature fakers"
controversy, pitting him against none other than the sitting president and
self-appointed authority on all things out-of-doors, Theodore Roosevelt. The
controversy began when a scientist named John Burroughs wrote an article called
"Real and Sham Natural History," in which he decried the appearance of
sympathetic and above all individualistic animal characters in the fiction of
the day. Burroughs claimed that all animal behavior was entirely instinctual,
and that the implications of reason and learned behavior in individual animals
on which these animal fictions relied constituted nature-fakery. To Burroughs,
the non-human animal is entirely mechanistic, an automaton driven by pure
instinct. [check in the actual essay---make sure this isn't an opportunistic
gloss by london] For his part, Roosevelt leveled petty complaints against
*White Fang*: he saw fakery in the claim that a lynx could kill a dog (which
does not happen in *White Fang*) and that a bull dog could beat a wolf dog in
a fight.[ditto] 

When these critiques began to appear, London did his best to keep out of it. As
he wrote several years later of the incident in an essay called "The Other
Animals": "when the word *nature-faker* was coined, I, for one, climbed into my
tree and stayed there...and a Honolulu reporter elicited the sentiment from me
that I thanked God I was not an authority on anything" [@london_other_???].
When he finally did climb down from his tree, he dismissed Roosevelt's claims
easily enough, describing the president as an "amateur" and saying he "does not
understand evolution, and he does not seem to have made much of an attempt to
understand evolution" [@london_other_???]. On this basis, he excused the
president's mistakes and suggested a more careful rereading of the works
Roosevelt critiqued.

In responding to Burroughs, London was more comprehensive and more damning, and
in being so reveals a continuity between his dog books and his meditations on
the human. In "The Other Animals," he recounts several experiences with his own
dogs that bear a clear relation to episodes in his fiction, analyzing them to
demonstrate reason triumphing over instinct. The drives of instinct and reason,
he says, come out of an evolutionary succession, with the former a "race-habit"
that "is blind, unreasoning, mechanical" and the latter a development that
culiminates in, but is not exlusive to, humanness itself. His concluding salvo
continues to place human and non-human on an evolutionary continuum, but in
doing so it also suggests that the process that leads to the human continues to
exist in the humans of the present:

> Mr. Burroughs, though you stand on the top of the ladder of life, you must
not kick out that ladder from under your feet. You must not deny your
relatives, the other animals. Their history is your history....What you
repudiate in them you repudiate in yourself — a pretty spectacle, truly, of an
exalted animal striving to disown the stuff of life out of which it is made,
striving by use of the very reason that was developed by evolution to deny the
processes of evolution that developed it. This may be good egotism, but it is
not good science.

<!--remember, "their history is your history" is from the epigraph to BA,
and also comes up in the Kempton-Wace Letters -->Embrace the animal, London tells us (with Burroughs as
a proxy), "exalted animal" though it may be. Claiming that human action is
driven exclusively by reason gives the lie to the very utility of that reason,
for reason paradoxically requires an admission of unreason in the form of more
atavistic drives. Contrary to the straw-man versions of naturalist determinism
that have marked critiques of the genre for over a century, animalistic drives
in the human and non-human alike are non-mechanistic. Rather, London's
naturalism positions these drives as a substratum that exists in a complex
mixture with the reason that both derives from and seeks to disown it. The
extent to which reason has developed is a matter of species.

<!-- somewhere in here could be an opportunity to intro species being, if
that's what I want to do. "At stake here is a concept called species-being as
it relates to the human...-->

But buried in this conclusion is another telling statement that complicates the
traditional boundaries between human history and natural history---the very
boundary that Chakrabarty and Baucom say the Anthropocene itself complicates.
"You must not deny your relatives, the other animals," London tells us. He
continues: *Their history is your history*. What appears a statement of
inter-species camaraderie becomes much more when considered in terms of
London's larger project in relation to species. He uses the species concept as
a starting point for a narrative exploration of the natural history of the
human---a unique kind of historical fiction, we might say, a natural history
fiction.

*Before Adam* is undoubtedly such a fiction, an attempt to bring to life, to
bring to experience, the natural history of the human. It experiments not so
much with different temporalities as with juxtaposed modes of experience
appropriate to different forms of consciousness in the history of the species,
just as other naturalist historical novels (Dreiser's *The Financier*, for
example) create the experience of an economic and social moment in human
history. Here the human *per se* is the object of historical inquiry. But
London himself highlights the novel's limitations as a general model for
experiencing species as more than a concept. [ quote from BA about the narrator
being an abnormal example of something that exists in everyone ]. If the
narrator is an extreme example of something that exists in everyone, the novel
in which he appears still leaves us with the crucial questions largely
unanswered: What does it mean to *live* species rather than think, not as
a transcendent experience but as a quotidian one? What does it mean to
experience the species as a defining category contingent on a moment in natural
history, in the way that certain historically contingent identities can be
experienced?

---

If *Before Adam* fails to address these questions, it is perhaps because it
fails to fully root itself in the experiences of either of the two moments it
depicts, fully inhabiting the experience of neither the Pleistocene nor the
Holocene. It may model a natural-historical fiction, but this fiction has the
narrative requirements as other forms of historical fiction. If he makes the
pre-human experience of the Pleistocene more accessible to a modern
consciousness, it may paint a clearer sketch of the process of speciation and
human development, in the same way that Dreiser makes the economic crisis of
1871 [?] open to experience to form an argument about the crisis-prone nature
of capitalism and finance. But neither novel does anything to expand the
temporal scale of their narration, a expansion without which any robust
experience of species remains out of reach. 

In a short story from the same period, "To Build a Fire," London performs just
such an expansion, and he does so by interrogating the classic naturalist
tropes of atavism and instinct. But in doing so he also presents a version of
the human that exceeds the category of biological species---and through
contrast with a canine character like those of *The Call of the Wild* and
*White Fang*, shows just how much the species-concept needs to be revised to be
experienced on human terms. The story tests the ways the forms of knowledge
that came to conflict in the "nature fakers" controversy define the experience
of species in canine and human subjects alike. It also pursues an
anti-essentialist definition of humanness as plastic and historically
contingent---a definition that effectively blends the historical and
natural-historical modes.

What makes these meditations on the human stand out even more distinctly is the
fact that they only exist in the second, longer version of the story---the
version written after *The Call of the Wild*, *White Fang*, and *Before Adam*.
"To Build a Fire" was first published as a much shorter story in [ ] magazine
in 1902. Shortly afterward, in 1903, *The Call of the Wild* was published to
popular acclaim, and was shortly followed by *White Fang* in 1906. Only after
exploring the narrative challenges of species in canine characters did he write
*Before Adam*, which was serialized in 1906 and 1907, extending to human
characters the explorations of species that come more naturally in reference to
non-human figures. Finally, in 1908, something he had discovered in writing
these books prompted him to return to the events of "To Build a Fire" with
a much more nuanced view of the human and a much more ambitious sense of the
philosophical vision it implies.

The early story forms a clear foundation for the later, canonical version. Both
feature a man traveling alone in temperatures less than negative-sixty degrees
(contrary to the advice of more experienced travelers) whose foot becomes
soaked with water. In both, the man struggles to build a fire to dry himself
out and stay alive, fighting the absolute numbness of his extremities to light
birch bark with a book of matches. But there are differences in the key events
as well, inviting a comparative reading. In the earlier story, the man makes it
back to camp with scars and an education. In the latter, he dies, and his
canine companion (who does not appear in the former version) returns without
him to "the other food-providers and fire-providers."[@london_build_2001 271]

With these two changes to the events of the story come more significant
philosophical implications, particularly about how reason and technology have
come to define the very essence of the human. Reason and technology are not
restricted to humans in his vision, however, merely existing in different
proportions with respect to other forms of knowing. Broadly speaking, knowledge
as such forms a barrier between the individual organism and death, and the
novel lays out three forms of such knowledge: instinct, reason, and social
knowledge. 

London is inconsistent regarding the extent to which each of these forms of
knowledge does indeed constitute knowledge. On one hand, instinct is presented
as something other than knowing. When, confronted with wet feet just as the man
is, the dog begins licking and biting its toes to break off the ice, London
draws a line between apparently automatic action and reason. The dog's
preventative measure "was a matter of instinct. To permit the ice to remain
would mean sore feet. It did not know this. It merely obeyed the mysterious
prompting that arose from the deep crypts of its being." In contrast, when the
man helps the dog remove the ice from its feet, he does so not out of some
coevolutionary impulse, but out of a deduced and self-serving rationale. No,
the dog did not know what the ice "meant": "But the man knew, having achieved
a judgment on the subject, and he removed the mitten from his right hand and
helped tear out the ice-particles."[@london_build_2001 263-4] Here is an
apparently familiar story about the line separating human and animal, not
unlike Burroughs's position in his excoriation of nature fakers. Where the man
"achieve[s] a judgment," the dog merely "obeys" a distinctly embodied
sedimentation of ancestral experiences. Dubbing the source of the dog's
instinctual response "the deep crypts of its being," London makes this action dead,
a stark contrast to the active language of the man's intellectual achievements.

But this familiar argument that places the non-human on the side of instinct
and the human on the side of reason is not London's argument, as is clear from
his response to Burroughs, and the easy division is quickly complicated. In the
first place, the dog of "To Build a Fire" has all the same capacity for reason
that London saw in his own dogs and that he ascribes to Buck and White Fang.
Responding to life-threatening cold, the dog has a learned response that
appears simultaneously with his instinctive one: "The dog had learned fire, and
it wanted fire, or else to burrow under the snow and cuddle its warmth away
from the air."[@london_build_2001 262] The dog prefers the fire it has learned
to depend on, but failing that, it has a reservoir of instinct to fall back on.
The man is not so lucky. Though he singularly fails to benefit from any
instinctive knowledge, however, it is not because of a lack in the instinctual
capacities of humanity as a species---as is clear in *Before Adam*, London
ascribes the same "deep crypts of being" to humans in varying degrees. It is
instead a matter of the man's particular ancestry: "This man did .not know cold.
Possibly all the generations of his ancestry had been ignorant of cold, of real
cold, of cold one hundred and seven degrees below freezing-point. But the dog
knew; all its ancestry knew, and it had inherited the knowledge."[... 264] We
understand by implication that things might be different for the man---*this*
man, not "man"---had his ancestors been more acquainted with the kind of cold
he confronts in the story. Furthermore, instinct is not a mysterious prompting
in this example, but a legitimate source of knowledge. The dog "knew", the man
"did not know" because of a difference in their access to instinctual
archives. 

<!-- I note at this point that the question of knowledge/forms thereof as
defining characteristics has become important... this sort of jives with what
I'm seeing in animal studies, Haraway and Wolfe, etc. Need to make this more
explicit sooner in the section-->Finally, both the human and non-human subjects
here have social relations that act as yet another source of knowledge. London
again and again observes, in both versions of the story, that the man has not
appreciated the advice of the "old-timer on Sulpher Creek" who warned him
against traveling alone, especially in temperatures below negative-fifty
degrees.[... 265] This, ultimately, is the man's cardinal sin, a lack of
respect for the accumulated knowledge of those who know the extreme environment
better than he does. For just as the individual alone in an extreme
environment is more fragile than in a group, the knowledge of the individual
is more fragile than collective knowledge: subject to gaps due to a lack of
both experience and so-called instinctual impulses as well as to simple
forgetfulness. Indeed, the man's demise could well stem from having "forgotten
to build a fire and thaw out" before sitting down to eat, which it is implied
would not have occurred had he travelled with companions or taken more heed of
advice.[... 264] 

What is more surprising is that his relationship with the dog could have
provided this social reservoir of knowledge were that relationship more
mutually supportive. The dog's instinctual reserves of wisdom are open to the
man, making (in theory if not in this case) inter-species sociality a route to
a replacement for those instinctual reserves that humanity lacks. Immediately
after drawing a sharp contrast between the man's lack of instinctual
understanding of the cold and the dog's awareness that "it was the time to lie
snug in a hole in the snow", London momentarily enters the dog's consciousness
to demonstrate an intentional withholding of what it knows: "there was no keen
intimacy between the dog and the man. The one was the toil-slave of the other,
and the only caresses it had ever received were the caresses of the whip-lash
and of harsh and menacing throat-sounds that threatened the whip-lash. So the
dog made no effort to communicate its apprehension to the man."[... 265] Cruel
treatment and exploitation are poor substitutes for social relationships, so no
transfer of information occurs. But the idea that instinct is communicable is,
in considering the species, remarkable---because we presume that instinctual
knowledge is either a shared *human* instinct (and does not need to be
communicated) or is inaccessible because it belongs to another species and is,
*ipso facto*, unable to communicated. London not only imagines a social life
that goes beyond the species, but suggests that such a social life is an
absolute necessity in certain environments.

The combination of the necessity of instinctual knowledge, the human's lack of
it, and the inter-species sociality as a replacement for it has a startling
implication in considering the fitness of humanity for survival. On its own,
the human is incomplete, just as "the man" as an individual is incomplete on
his own in the Yukon. He needs either the living sociality of advice and
companions, discourse with the dead in the form of a speaking archive of
instinctual knowledge, or the inter-species relationships that are enabled by
domestication (or symbiosis in the case of other species). 

To briefly summarize before moving on, then, London draws the species line
according to the availability of different types of knowledge, but he is not
absolutist in the way that Burroughs is or others are who claim that reason or
socialization uniquely define the human. Rather, London posits that the
characters of human and non-human species alike are defined by unique
combinations of these types of knowledge (to say nothing of the sensory) and
the ways in which they are determinative or not of action. 

---

Narratively rendering a comparative definition of species, however, is not the
same as narrating an *experience* of species as such as an identity. "The man"
never comes to an epiphanic understanding of himself as a member of the
species, but juxtaposition with the dog becomes the narrative mechanism by
which experiences that define the human species are identified as such.
In laying out a knowledge-based theory of species, London creates his concept
of humanness; but in narrating these moments in the context of that conceptual
framework, London pursues the phenomenology of species itself.

Indeed, the first glimmer of species-thinking in the story is a rejection of
the conceptual, but the rejection itself is a telling one: in the absence of
meditation on species, there is a more direct access to the behaviors that
define London's concept of the human. Confronted with temperatures more than
fifty degrees below zero, the man is entirely unreflective:

> The trouble with him was that he was without imagination. He was quick and
alert in the things of life, but only in the things, and not in the
significances. Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty-odd degrees of frost. Such
fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did
not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and
upon man's frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits
of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural
field of immortality and man's place in the universe. [... 261]

What defines the man and his narrative function in the story is also the very
"trouble with him". Here London establishes the man purely as a nexus of
experience and sensation, devoid of theorization or even imagination. In the
same stroke, the narrator assigns duty of both to the reader. The scornful
negatives, the litany of all the things the man *did not* do, act as
a challenge and establish the lens through which we are to understand the
sensory data and impressions conveyed by the rest of the narrative. The human
is also removed from a place of mastery over nature, and even from a position
of uniqueness among animals, becoming a "creature of temperature"---mere
organism, contingent on certain material conditions to arise and persist. What
the man expresses as cold and discomfort we are now primed to understand as
a specimen straying outside the narrow window of habitability appropriate to
its species. And yet it still sets up a narrative emphasis on the
phenomenological, the negative statements working to establish a frame of
reference while simultaneously refusing to foreground the material out of which
that frame is composed.

The title of the story, "To Build a Fire," takes on a new significance with
this "frailty" of the species in mind, as well as the insistent centrality of
temperature in the story as a whole and this definition of the human as
a "creature of temperature" in particular. The fire serves double-duty as
a dramatic conceit and the basic Promethean symbol, encapsulating the human's
reliance on technology for survival by asking us to consider the vulnerability
that reliance creates. But when the human is defined by the slim envelope of
temperatures that can support our existence, the fire comes to bear existential
weight on the level of the species. The phrase "to build a fire," an insistent
repetition throughout the story, is a statement of humanness itself in
a distinctly material sense. 

London's definition of the human by fire is one that is shared by current
scientists. The primatologist Richard Wrangham, for example, argues in
*Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human* that cooking increased the amount of
energy obtained from food, the effects of which not only aided in the survival
of the species, but spurred the development of humanity itself. The
energy-hungry, inefficient digestive systems of humanity's predecessors gave
way to smaller digestive systems adapted to a more efficient cooked diet, as
well as a number of other physical adaptations like weaker jaws;[@wrangham
38-41] this change in the relative costs and gains in energy in turn is thought
to have spurred brain growth in turn.[@wrangham 105-6] Nor were these
adaptations limited to the human as a bounded biological agent. As their
"bodies responded by biologically adapting to cooked food" and the species, now
more resilient, spread across the planet, there were attendant ripples in the
area of the human's effects: "changes in anatomy, physiology, ecology, life
history, psychology, and society"---and, we must now add in light of the
Anthropocene, in geology. For London and Wrangham both, the development of the
human as we know it relied on the ability to exceed the boundaries of the self,
encompassing the things we use to define ourselves. "The man's" fire is thus as
defining as the wolf's coat.

<!-- interesting note from Wrangham on Darwin:

He cited his fellow evolutionist Alfred Russel Wallace approvingly: “man is
enabled through his mental faculties ‘to keep with an unchanged body in harmony
with the changing universe.’” The control of fire was just another way for an
unchanged body with an adept mental faculty to respond to a natural challenge.
“When he migrates into a colder climate he uses clothes, builds sheds, and
makes fires; and, by the aid of fire, cooks food otherwise indigestible
. . . the lower animals, on the other hand, must have their bodily structure
modified in order to survive under greatly changed conditions.” (21)

-->

<!-- technology and prosthesis stuff, appendages, tobacco beard, birch,
etc.-->Consistent with its function as a Promethean symbol, fire in London's
story is merely the representative example of the technological appendages that
come to define the very essence of the human. The most direct example of this
trend is the most ambiguous and the least appealing. The man chews tobacco as
he travels, but his frozen beard and numbed lips mean his spit accumulates in
his beard and freezes: "The result was that a crystal beard of the color and
solidity of amber was increasing its length on his chin. If he fell down it
would shatter itself, like glass, into brittle fragments. But he did not mind
the appendage."[... 262] The man's reliance on processed tobacco alters his
physical being, making him into a strange hybrid of his natural being and the
things he makes use of. But this extra-natural appendage is fragile by nature,
and it is hardly introduced before we are supplied with the image of it
shattering. This would be no tragedy, the amber beard conferring no imaginable
advantage. Other, more common appendages are presented as complementary
prosthetics to make up for the natural protections the human lacks. Although
"he was a warm-whiskered man," for example, "the hair on his face did not
protect the high cheek-bones," and the man therefore has to continually agitate
"his numb nose and cheek-bones with his mittened hand."[... 261] He eventually
comes to execute this process "automatically," putting it in the unthinking
realm of natural or instinctual action while simultaneously describing it with
the lexicon of industry.[... 262] Even this appendage is not incorporated
firmly enough into the man's being, however, still requiring a certain degree
of attention. He notes with "a pang of regret that he had not devised
a nose-strap of the sort Bud wore in cold snaps. Such a strap passed across the
cheeks, as well, and saved them."[... 263]. Lacking a natural protection for
his cheeks against the cold, the man's best hope of survival is to change his
very being with increasingly refined appendages, replacing the natural with the
technological. 

While these appendages, like the fire, remain external, they are nonetheless
constitutive of the very essence of the human---if not individually, then as
a process. As Darwin himself put it, "man is enabled through his mental
faculties 'to keep with an unchanged body in harmony with the changing
universe'", which is achieved when "he uses clothes, builds sheds, and makes
fires"---whereas non-human animals "must have their bodily structure modified
in order to survive under greatly changed conditions."[qtd. in @Wrangham 21
(check page)] The uniquely human strategies for survival itself, which in the
eyes of the evolutionist (professional or amateur) are coextensive with the
defining human character, are contingent on the degree of technological
adaptation in response to a changing environment.

But technology's role in this story is hardly that of an uncomplicated savior.
London goes beyond a purely salutary view of the technological human, beyond an
account in which the human as an intelligent mind fills the gaps of the human
as an organism. The same fragility of the tobacco-beard that shatters under the
least pressure is attributed to humanity's over-reliance on technology for
survival. One metaphor, appearing twice near the end of the story, drives this
association home particularly clearly. As the man begins to lose sensation in
his fingers, the metaphor that recommends itself is a technological one, just
as when the man "automatically" rubbed his cheeks with his mittened hands. But
now it is with a sense of fragility that touches the basic makeup of the man's
body: "When he touched a twig, he had to look and see whether or not he had
hold of it. The wires were pretty well down between him and his finger-ends";
and again, "he closed [his fingers]---that is, he willed to close them, for the
wires were down, and the fingers did not obey."[... 268] The intervention of
this technological metaphor marks the man's loss of contact with his own body,
an ultimate separation of mental and corporeal being made manifest by the
dissolution of the body while the mind remains active. Whereas earlier the
technological appendages appeared as supplements, they are now barriers between
the man's consciousness and his physical self---between the individual intellect and
the more basic substratum of being that is determined by species. The loss of
a connection between the mind and body comes to symbolize the loss of
a connection between the intellectual human and the human species.

Finally, this lost connection has a greater cosmic significance than the death
of an individual character. To London, it means a loss of the connection
between the human and the natural environment. In another telling repetition,
London suggests that our connection with the planet is bodily rather than
intellectual: "He glanced down at first in order to assure himself that he was
really standing up, for the absence of sensation in his feet left him unrelated
to the earth"; and on the next page, as the man runs on feet that are entirely
numb, "He seemed to himself to skim along above the surface, and to have no
connection with the earth."[... 269-70] The statement would draw attention even
without repetition, but as when he discusses the "wires" being down, London
appears unwilling to let this idea go unnoticed. In both cases, consciousness
itself is not enough for a meaningful relationship to one's immediate
environment, and this fact appears to be much of what makes the man's
disembodiment difficult for him to come to terms with. But London's phrasing
here suggests a broader interpretation than one of mere disorientation,
a reading that encompasses capital-E-Earth as well as the simpler
earth-as-ground that forms the man's point of reference. The loss of contact
with one's body, the suggestion that the human is pure consciousness without
a meaningful physical being, means the loss of perspective regarding the
human's place in the larger collage of planetary systems, including the
interrelation of species (like the communication between man and dog) and
effects on the environment more broadly conceived. 

This body-planet connection is stunningly evoked in a passage that broadens the
man's conception of his place in the universe even further. 

> His pace of four miles an hour had kept his heart pumping blood to the
surface of his body and to all the extremities. But the instant he stopped, the
action of the pump eased down. The cold of space smote the unprotected tip of
the planet, and he, being on that unprotected tip, received the full force of
the blow. The blood of his body recoiled before it. The blood was alive, like
the dog, and like the dog it wanted to hide away and cover itself up from the
fearful cold.[...266]

The effect of this stunning passage relies on a juxtaposition of scales about
as violent as it is possible to achieve, from the interior of the human body in
one sentence to the movement of astral bodies in the next. As the first
sentence depicts the slowing of a single organ, the second takes its vantage
point from a point beyond the planet itself, depicting the man's deadly loss of
heat in terms of the entire sum of the material systems that have caused it.
The man's insignificance is driven home by the vastness of the universe in
which it occurs just as he is rendered a part of that universe, one event in
a larger chain of causality. In the moment following this mechanistic
description of freezing, the narration turns to the purely bodily, imagining
the physical side of the human as an agent unto itself. This pure physicality,
"the blood", reacts mechanistically, and this mechanism is related to the dog's
prompting from the "crypts" of accreted instinctual knowledge. Even as the man
remains unaware of the desires and actions of his physical being, these desires
are the source of connection to both the immediate and the cosmic environment,
which with the right frame of reference are one and the same. To lose one's
connection to the body through technological interventions is to lose all
frames of reference beyond the self, to lose the sense of the universal in the
individual.

<!--use this to introduce a mini-sb section within this...-->"To Build a Fire",
then, is finally an exploration of the way an ever more technologically
mediated essence changes the place of the human in all possible environments,
from the most immediate (the relationship with the dog) to the most distant
(the place on the planet as a whole). But regarding London's conception of the
species as such, and the notion of an essential species experience, this
conclusion raises more questions than it answers. Chief among them are the
following: How is it possible for the defining characteristic of a species to
be defined by technology, something that is historically contingent? And what,
then, is the proper context in which to seek an understanding of the human
species---history or natural history? Finally, how is it possible for the
so-called "natural" being of the human to simultaneously create a separation
between the self and the environment in which the self exists?


### "History is the true natural history of man"

<!--this section really needs to be incorporated above-->

These questions, posed by London's narrative engagement with species, are
answerable by the concept of "species-being", a term whose very composition
seems to undercut Chakrabarty's contention that the species is not able to be
experienced except intellectually. [ brief punchy summary ] It is best known as
a Marxian concept, appearing in the *Economic of Philosophical Manuscripts of
1844* alongside the formative passages in the theory of the alienation of
labor. It has, however, experienced the beginnings of a revival in discussions
of the Anthropocene. [wark, others?]

<!-- section: Marx: s-b is contingent while being universal; historical change
is a change in essence; talking about species is not the same as talking
about static unchanging essentialism; we can have both "their history is your
history" and "history is the true natural history of man"-->



### Interlude: *The Acorn-Planter* and Speculative Human Species-Being

<!--the previous section should end with something like... 

wait what does that section show us in the end?

London understands human species-being, by way of animal species-being, as
a combination of the following:

1. something both universal and subject to adaptation across individual
organisms

2. fundamentally rooted in human use of technology and the prosthetic humanism
that results (need harraway) as well as a larger social organism; both of these
are the site of individual variation

3. therefore historically contingent, i.e., variegated across period and
region; a capacious view of technology that appears to include human
environments altered by technology as well as social structures. 

-->

The socio-technological definition of human species-being in "To Build a Fire"
appears to capture London's view of human species-being as it *was*; but he was
just as invested in human species-being as it *could be*. Indeed, though he has
a reputation for rigidly deterministic views of human behavior, he seemed to
take this fixity as a mere basis from which the human species could develop its
collective nature. 

In his notes for a lecture delivered in Oakland, California sometime before
1904<!--can the letters tell me when?-->, for example, he states his views on
environmental determination of the human clearly: "Environment determines
absolutely," causing all forms of life to do the "easiest thing" in all cases,
despite the human illusion of volition. And yet it is possible for the actions
of individual or collective actions to "have altered [the] environment" such
that it determines what the "easiest thing" is. He comes to the point of his
elaborations: 

>We have individual telic actions; in small groups we even have collective
telic action, but in society as a whole we do not have collective telic action.
Things are helter skelter.

>Wherefore the demand is made, that since as individuals, we all perform telic
actions, let us collectively perform telic actions, and not go on in the blind,
haphazard way we are now going on.

As is clear from the context of the rest of the speech, the "we" here is
nothing less than the human species, conceived as a collective. In order to
have the capacity for univocal volition, a type of activity is required of the
human collective that has not been possible to that point, a type of action
that has the teleology of individual action on the scale of the human
collective. Though framed here as a simple matter of choice (hence the
exhortation), by the time of *Before Adam*'s publication London would come to
see the capacity for collective teleological action on a smaller scale as an
important step in the development of human species-being, one of the defining
advantages the Fire People have over the less resilient Tree People.<!--make
sure I set this up earlier--> By calling for further expansion of the
collective capacity for "telic action", then, London is calling for the next
step in the transformation of human species-being as a he understands
it.[@JLCollection JL1251 "Speech on Free Will and Environment"]

But to what end does he seek a guided evolution of the human species? To put it
another way: if this is a vision of teleological collective action, what is the
*telos*? In the context of his speech, it would probably have been in line with
the goals of the ISS [uhh make sure it's this one and remember what the full
name is] and the rest of the contemporaneous American socialist movement, as
were the majority of his public speaking engagements. Where Jack London's
thinking on species comes into contact with his thinking on environmental
destruction, however---in other words, where he becomes most explicitly
Anthropocenic---is in his vision of a more ecological human species-being for
the future.

London's concept of an ecological species-being developed mostly in the final
years of his life, and so it is no surprise that the most paradigmatic
statement appears in *The Acorn-Planter --- A California Forest Play*, a play
written and published (but never performed) in 1916, the year before his
death.[^ln-ap-labor] His notes towards what he calls the play's "argument" are
more explicit than the final version of the play itself on this point: "The
soil & the world belong to those who make the soil & the world most fruitful
& thereby make possible life more _abundant_. [...] the duty of life [...] is
to make life more abundant." In this remarkable note, London defines human
species-being according to an ecological ethic. Making life more "abundant" is
both the duty of all living things and the conditions for staking a claim to
the world as a whole. Though the sense in which he means "belongs to" is
ambiguous, given London's political commitments, it would not be unreasonable
to take it as a literal statement of property, or rather, a schema for the
abolition of property. [@JLCollection JL2059]

[^ln-ap-labor]: In the front matter of the play itself, London specifies that
*The Acorn-Planter* was to "Be Sung by Efficient Singers Accompanied by
a Capable Orchestra." Planned to be performed for the Bohemian Club, of which
he and Frank Norris were members, the play's demands apparently exceeded its
context, for the requisite efficient singers and capable orchestra were never
found. See [@labor_all_1976].

Taken in the larger dramatic context of *The Acorn-Planter*, however, this
statement's easy assumption of a unified humanity becomes predictably
complicated. In short, these musings occur in a context of colonial conquest
that London was entirely unequipped to handle. He conceived of the plot in
terms of "Indian & White", "2 motifs that are [in] apparent conflict that is
reconciled in _the end_."[@JLCollection JL2059] Red Cloud is the titular
"Acorn-Planter," leader of the Nishinam tribe according to a hereditary line
leading from the "first man" and first Acorn-Planter. In the face of a prophecy
telling of the coming "Sun Man" who will destroy the Nishinam, Red Cloud
promotes peace and the propagation of beauty and life in contrast to the
bellicose inclinations of the "War Chief". When European explorers arrive
matching the description in the prophecy, Red Cloud and the Sun Man identify
themselves according to parallel archetypes of two traditions (at least as
London imagines them): 

> RED CLOUD: I am the Fire-Bringer. I stole the fire from the ground squirrel
and hid it in the heart of the wood. 

> SUN MAN: Then am I Prometheus, your brother. I stole the fire from heaven and
hid it in the heart of the wood. 

> RED CLOUD: I am the Acorn-Planter. I am the Food-Bringer, the Life-Maker.
I make food for more life, ever more life.

> SUN MAN: Then am I truly your brother. Life-Maker am I, tilling the soil in
the sweat of my brow from the beginning of time, planting all manner of good
seeds for the harvest.[@london_acorn_1916 45]

The first commonality the two assert is identification with the mastery of
fire---which for London, as we have seen, is a symbol of human species-being.
Immediately on the heels of this affirmed humanity is is the commitment to
spreading more life. This commitment relies, however, on surpassing the
bellicose nature embodied by the War Chief. Once surpassed, a new era of
humanity is promised: "Lo, the New Day Dawns, / The day of brotherhood, / The
day when all men / Shall be kind to all men, / And all men shall be sowers of
life."[@london_acorn_1916 81].

But the message of mutual fellowship in service of the shared planet is
undercut by an ahistorical and manipulative account of California's conquest by
white settlers. Despite the efforts of Red Cloud and the leader of the Sun Men
(called only the Sun Man) to form a friendship, the War Chief and his followers
kill the explorers with stolen muskets, prompting the dying Sun Man to prophecy
the destruction of the Nishinam by his "brothers": "Many are our brothers and
strong. They will come after us. [...] When you plant blood you harvest blood."
In the second act, which takes place a century later, the Sun Men return to
slaughter the Nishinam and take control of California, after a prolonged
exchange with the living incarnation of Red Cloud in which he and the Sun Man
agree that white settlers will increase the abundance of life on the land
through agriculture.[@london_acorn_1916 72] Stripping the figures of their
individual identities by identifying them with mythic figures, London stages an
allegorical struggle for the land between Europeans and American Indians in the
interactions of these typological figures. He does so through a distorting
lens that justifies white violence as a response to the aggression of the
Nishinam while making a mockery of the indigenous traditions of the Americas
through ludicrous pastiche. Though the possibility of a defining human *telos*
that compels increased abundance of life on the planet is intriguing in itself,
it is pursued here as a rationale for colonialism.

Why consider this vision of human species-being at all, then? In short, because
the *Acorn-Planter* version of London's speculative species-being is merely one
particularly clear articulation of an idea that he explored in different forms
across his late agricultural novels, and the celebration of white colonial
conquest at the play's end is a direct contradiction of his stance in other,
more critical works. Indeed, one need not even reach beyond *The Acorn-Planter*
itself to find London contradicting himself.<!--mark-->

...

[What is most startling about the note is that the two
statements, taken together, seem to disenfranchise much of humanity. Failing
our collective duty, modern humans can hardly be said to make life more
abundant, a fact that goes without saying in the twenty-first century but was
already clear to many like London observing ecological trends in the first
decades of the twentieth. Failing this duty in turn means that humanity would
lose the claim to the natural world we have asserted explicitly since Bacon.
Far from endorsing the inexhaustible claim to nature implied by the
technological humanism of "To Build a Fire", London's speculative species-being
is predicated on the conditionality of that claim.[2059]]



[ oops not that easy, cuz history and racism: acorn planter note/summary ]

[contradicts common view of London as purely deterministic and fully committed
to the "law of tooth and fang" version of his environmental imaginary. This
developed at the end of his life, particularly in VM... Earl Labor 155 on VM]

[what does this look like in a non-speculative setting? VM and agro novels
give us a hint; but as in A-P, the utopian humanism is compromised by
a ham-headed conception of racial supremecy as a defining aspect of the species
conversation. We need to ask: is it possible to envision a pluralistic
universal humanism, guided from within according to partially but not entirely
technological means, without also accepting the view that this battle for
supremecy has to be concluded first? (the supremecy thing is from the
archives... maybe best not to go there for time reasons) VM actually presents
a counter-point, somewhat similar to A-P but with a different approach to race.
It remains appropriative but also shows how the supremecist logic that is given
voice in A-P and the beginning of VM collapses under its own weight.]

[eventually: London is trying to voice a progressive version of species-being but getting in
his own way with an understanding of race that makes species-unity impossible
(but does it? Isn't there room for Saxon's eventual pluralism?)]


### Species, Race, and Agricultural Species-Being

Experiencing humanness *per se*, and doing so on a scale that exceeds the
individual, has ramifications for London's environmental consciousness just as
it does for environmental consciousness in the Anthropocene. Nowhere is this
more evident than in his agricultural novels, written in the final years of his
life as he worked his "Beauty Ranch," an experimental farm in the Sonoma
Valley, California, which became a material staging ground for his budding
ecological consciousness. 

*Burning Daylight* (1910) can be read as narrating the development of such
a consciousness. Just as London's best-known writing begins with stories of dog
running and gold mining in the far north and concluded in agricultural
narratives, Elam "Burning Daylight" Harnish's story begins when he goes from
carrying mail in the Yukon [check task and place] to striking it rich on
fortuitous gold claims [I think it's more complex than this...]. His extractive
impulse leads him naturally into financial speculation and thus to the urban
centers of California, where he experiences the classic naturalist "plot of
decline" as distance from his wilderness roots takes its toll through the
drinking and inactivity it engenders. London paints a portrait of a typological
figure whose very physical being and essential character transforms as a result
of a change in his environment, and the loss is rendered in terms that are
understood historically as reflecting a change in the fundamental nature of the
species. The only way for Harnish to regain his physical vitality is to abandon
a capitalist conception of land in favor of a respectful engagement with it, an
engagement that is aesthetic at the same time that it is horticultural and
ecological. Rather than extracting value from land in the form of rent, Harnish
begins to value the land itself based on its health and an autonomy that
approximates that of the wild north from which he came. But it is not wildness
itself that he values---rather, it is his relationship with the land,
a relationship that is active without being extractive, encouraging growth that
increases the productive capacity of the land whether or not what is produced
is profitable. In order to attain this state of horticultural enlightenment, he
has to come to an understanding of the influence environment has on his basic
being, or in other words of the naturalist logic of determinism that cuts right
to the genre's conception of humanness itself. When a small landslide in his
new idealized natural environment reveals a strain of gold, he feels himself
momentarily pulled back into the extractive, urban version of the human that he
has fought hard to escape. In an important symbolic moment, he covers the gold
back up, knowingly choosing an atavistic human existence to preserve himself
and his immediate environment in the same act. A dynamic relationship to
species, one that balances determinism of possible futures with a free act of
choice among those futures, is the basis of this environmental praxis.

*The Valley of the Moon* (1913) is in many ways a reprise of the themes of
*Burning Daylight* that pushes even further both the atavistic relation to
species and the resultant environmental praxis. The novel is neatly divided
between sections dealing with the city and the country, setting up a neat test
case for the naturalist urban premise of the naturalist plot of decline. Billy
and Saxon effect a flight from the city of Oakland when teamster union strikes
are put down by zealous police violence---and because of Billy's surrender to
alcohol that is the partial result. The second half of the novel chronicles
their travels in search of a plot of land, which they idealize by imagining as
a "valley of the moon," otherworldly and perhaps unattainable. [check? where
does the valley of the moon thing begin?] On the way to finding this land,
a clear proxy for London's own "Beauty Ranch," Billy and Saxon gather
horticultural knowledge from a combination of farming operations owned and
managed by immigrant communities, market gardeners with upscale clientele, and
a set of books and pamphlets that represent a cross-section of London's own
Beauty Ranch horticultural library.[^ln-tichi] Putting this collected wisdom
into practice has an effect on Billy and Saxon similar to what Elam Harnish
experiences in *Burning Daylight*: they settle into a hard-working but
unalienated routine of agricultural labor and living, having escaped the
degrading influence of urbanity. Billy and Saxon's story follows a "back-to-the
land" motif that is built on the naturalist logic of determinism and decline
while complicating that logic at the same time. Conceding a degree of
environmental determinism, at least as far as the broad categories of rural and
urban environments, the pair nevertheless have a degree of choice in choosing
a new environment and in transforming the environment they find themselves
in---which transformation is possible to a much greater degree beyond the dense
and alienated environment of the city.

For Billy and Saxon, choosing among possible environments and, by extension,
possible modes of being also entails choosing how to relate to their forebears.
They experience a more voluntary form of the atavism of *Before Adam*: where
*BA*'s protagonist unwittingly exceeds the boundaries of individual experience,
Billy and Saxon seek out a consciousness that exceeds themselves and the
timescale of the individual. They willfully change their environment and their
relation to it only after understanding themselves in terms of their forebears
and of broader historical action. In the first place, they understand their
exploration of California in search of land as an extension of their family
history several generations back. [quotes] But this broadening of the self goes
back even further, into a shared fantasy of a seafaring past through which they
understand their own nomadic existence. [quotes] 

Finally, these attempts to connect with personal family histories, real or
imagined, coincide with an understanding of the land itself not as it is, but
as a process resulting in its current state. Billy and Saxon (especially Saxon)
see the conventional wisdom of California farmers gone badly awry, represented
most succinctly by a farmer who brags about how many plots of land he has
single-handedly exhausted. They also see in the larger environmental history of
the country this same short-sightedness, an agricultural mode oriented to
building cities by stripping the countrysides with no thought given to
maintaining the soil. In other words, they discover that the same forces that
produced the environment from which they fled have also looted the Arcadia they
hoped to find. Their atavism gives them a counterpoint, a second comparative
perspective with which they can see the destruction wrought by too great
a degree of human influence on our environment. The wider view they gain
ultimately allows them to make a different choice. Rejecting the trend, they
begin systematically building the soil on first one farm, then several in the
Sonoma Valley. The novel concludes with Saxon becoming pregnant, something they
worried would not be possible after their travails in the city led to
a miscarriage. This ending establishes a clear symbolic link (albeit
a troubling one from an ecofeminist perspective) between their integration into
a larger narrative of heredity and species and the discovery of an alternative
to environmental destruction. 

And yet, in *The Valley of the Moon* and much of London's larger body of work,
the topic that stands out most clearly is not species, but race. Indeed, the
two concepts can be difficult to untangle in London's work, a fact that does
nothing to quell concerns that any discourse predicated on the species will
risk being inherently regressive. Billy and Saxon's attempts to understand
themselves in a larger timescale is often framed as a quest for a racially pure
identity. They initially bond over a shared "Anglo-Saxon" lineage and routinely
utter nativist commonplaces. As a result, criticism of *The Valley of the Moon*
has largely, if understandably, missed the environmentalist forest for the
racist trees. 

But there is good reason to question any reading of *The Valley of the Moon*
that takes these nativist sentiments at face value, treating them as either
stable throughout the novel or as expressions of an uncomplicated perspective
of London's own. Rather, in the scope of the entire novel, this nativism and
white supremecism must be understood as objects of critique. Despite her name,
Saxon becomes a proponent of what London sometimes called the "Brotherhood of
Man,"[^ln-brotherhood] resisting and mocking Billy's sense of racial
superiority. [an example or two] Though at the beginning of their journey they
search for contact with their personal mythology of an Anglo-Saxonism based on
a seafaring and homesteading past, by its end that narrative has failed them.
Though they still harbor a belief that their ancestry makes them
"zone-conquerors" destined to expand and take over whatever is on their
horizon, they come to realize that this "conquering" is really just
destruction. [quote about white people wrecking everything] Furthermore, Saxon
sees the inverse of this destructive impulse in the practices of the people
Billy sees as his inferiors. London's classic white superman becomes a figure
of ridicule, part of the very problem that London positions as a cause of the
growing environmental crisis. Resisting it requires renouncing this supremecism
and embracing a sort of pluralism instead, while still retaining a sense of
themselves in terms of a larger encompassing human identity. In *The Valley of
the Moon*, the supposedly determined characteristics of Anglo-Saxonism become
the root of all environmental evils, while the solution is to embrace the
cultural differences that define the human species.
