> For my fear is the fear of long ago, the fear that was rampant in the Younger
World, and in the youth of the Younger World. In short, the fear that reigned
supreme in that period known as the Mid-Pleistocene. (1)

Jack London's *Before Adam* (year) begins with an act of geological
periodization. But the object of this periodization is not a stratigraphic
record, the layers of mineral sedimentation that make up the inorganic archive
of the planet. The archive here is the periodizing consciousness itself, having
gained access to the accreted layers of memory that make up its identity---an
identity that in turn encompasses far more than a sum of individual
experiences. 

... [novel summary]

Jack London's geology, in short, is a geology of the human, a geology in which
the human is both the subject and object of study. A century later, we have
a name for this geology: the Anthropocene. <!--room for mini arg-statmeent
here?--> [explores the intersection of geology (?), the species, and the
individual consciousness in London]

Of course, though technically only designating a geological epoch defined by
the influence of collective human activity, the term "Anthropocene" has always
indicated much more than a geological consideration of the human. Even in some
of the earliest uses of the term, it had already come to indicate anthropogenic
destruction of the planet through means as diverse as carbon emissions,
deforestation, population growth, and animal domestication
[@crutzen_geology_2002, @crutzen_"anthropocene"_2006]. Considering the "human
species" as a universalizing concept is both an explanation of this destruction
and a response to it. According to Dipesh Chakrabarty, in his seminal essay
"The Climate of History: Four Theses," "Species may indeed be the name of
a placeholder for an emergent, new universal history of humans that flashes up
in the moment of the danger that is climate change" [-@chakrabarty_climate_2009
221]. If our "moment of danger" is causing us to reach for the "species"
concept, causing us to seek a biological collective that exceeds and comprises
the individual, it is in response to a dual relationship to mass extinction. We
recognize on one hand that the human collective has become a destructive force
by its very nature, exceeding the capacities usually known to biology. But we
recognize at the same time that this destructiveness does not come with
omnipotence. To think of the human in a superhuman timescale is to take
seriously the threat of self-inflicted mass extinction, to place ourselves in
the long history of lifeforms coming into being and disappearing in
a geological moment.

And yet, though the species is a universal concept that "flashes up" in an
existentially threatening moment, it inhabits a timescale too far removed from
that of human experience to be easily apprehensible---or, for that matter,
apprehensible at all. As Chakrabarty has it: 

> Who is the we? We humans never experience ourselves as a species. We can only
intellectually comprehend or infer the existence of the human species but never
experience it as such. There could be no phenomenology of us as a species. Even
if we were to emotionally identify with a word like mankind, we would not know
what being a species is, for, in species history, humans are only an instance
of the concept species as indeed would be any other life form. But one never
experiences being a concept. (220)

We may be able to conceive of the totality, and we may be able to experience it
as a kind of guilt. But the phenomenological gap between the self and the
species is too large: species may always be already embodied, but it is never
experienced as such. The Anthropocene then presents a moment of distinct crisis
in the individual imagination. Thinking our new epoch requires that the
individual experience be expanded even further beyond the self than what normal
historical consciousness requires, a collectivity that is less an
identification with something larger than an interrogation of an embodied
identity, a recognition of the collective that is stitched into the fabric of
each individual. 

Herein, of course, lies the great danger of species-thinking as a theoretical
program. It risks ignoring a half-century of critical theory, the very basis of
which is opposition to the kind of essentialism a discourse of the human
species would seem to imply. Ian Baucom, considering Chakrabarty's universal
species concept, points out that "it seems to wreak havoc on the key principles
of historical understanding and political commitment that have animated not
only Chakrabarty’s preceding body of work, but the broader project of
postcolonial critique to which that work has been dedicated"
[-@baucom_human_2012 3]. To consider the species concept as a universal of the
same type as those that postcolonial critique has opposed in the past, however,
would be to miss Chakrabarty's point. It is not a universalism in the Hegelian
mode, which Chakrabarty himself has opposed in the name of a struggle for the
"freedom of difference," but a "natural--scientific" universalism that presents
a new paradigm entirely[@-baucom_human_2012 3]. As Baucom reads it, in this new
paradigm "freedom can no longer be conceived of as the freedom of difference
against the power of the globalizing same." Rather, because "freedom" now
relies on survival through a collective effort to save the planet by
transforming our relationship to it, this universal concept has become a *sine
qua non* of freedom itself. The pursuit of freedom is now "a task of the
species, as species, for the species. It is a universal human challenge,
a challenge of humanity’s shared natural history and its shared planetary
future" [-@baucom_human_2012 3]. 

The problem of species, of the "*anthropos*" in the Anthropocene, is thus
manifold and entangled. It demands a natural-scientific universalism that takes
the species concept as the basis for human history and as the starting point in
the struggle for freedom. It requires an understanding of anthropogenic
planetary change based on this species history. But in developing such
a species history, we risk backsliding into the essentialisms of the past, and
thus a concerted effort must be made to differentiate a natural-scientific
universalism of collective survival from the universals of the past that have
long been used to justify programs of domination and supremacy. 

And yet over all these tasks hovers an enduring paradox: to address the
conceptual and practical challenges of the Anthropocene, we must embrace
a concept that Chakrabarty claims fundamentally exceeds the capacities of human
experience, that has no phenomenology, that is somehow both embodied and
inaccessible.

Though differently framed, the defining questions and formal characteristics of
literary naturalism speak directly to this set of concerns. In pursuing the
well-trodden ground of the "determinism" question in literary naturalism,
critics of the genre have debated the role of species characteristics in
determining the actions and experiences of the
individual.[^ln-determinism-species-examples] The naturalist character is,
famously or notoriously, less notable as an individual subjectivity than as
a nexus of warring deterministic forces. The most marked conflicts occur
between "forces" defined by evolutionary conditioning and those that are
a product of a physical and social environment, especially in the context of
urban environments.[ Norris examples? ] Introducing the species concept into
this discourse merely requires a reminder that speciation is the product of
evolutionary variation.

[^ln-determinism-species-examples]: some examples of naturalist criticism that
drives this home? Look at the classics: Pizer, Walcutt... "Determined Fictions"

But when this common reading of the naturalist character is recast not just in
terms of the species concept, but in terms of the species concept with all the
resonances it has gained in the discourse of the Anthropocene, readings of the
naturalist form and its philosophical underpinnings alike gain added
significance. In treating characters as more than individual subjectivities, as
typological figures and as products of biological and environmental conditions,
the narrative strategies unique to naturalist fiction pursue the same
imaginative capacities that are required to conceive of the species as
a category of experience as well as an abstract scientific concept<!--too
convoluted, rewrite-->. It is through fear, a visceral and decidedly
unscientific experience, that the *Before Adam* protagonist accesses the
history of the species. To feel the fear of the Pleistocene epoch is to recall
a distinctly different humanity, one that has not superceded the bounds of
biological agency to become geological---indeed, one that has not yet removed
itself from the food chain or secured its sustenance through the soft conquest
of agriculture and animal domestication. To recall this earlier state of being
in the context of evolutionary history is to draw the outline of the human
species itself through a rare experiential link. The result is not an abstract
conception but a duality of being that encompasses a multi-epochal humanness. 

Experiencing humanness *per se*, and doing so on a scale that exceeds the
individual, has ramifications for London's environmental consciousness just as 
it does for environmental consciousness in the Anthropocene. Nowhere is this
more evident than in his agricultural novels, written in the final years of his
life as he worked his "Beauty Ranch," an experimental farm in the [Sonoma
Valley] that became a material staging ground for his budding ecological
consciousness. 

*Burning Daylight* (1910) can be read as narrating the development of such
a consciousness. Just as London's best-known writing begins with stories of dog
running and gold mining in the far north and concluded in agricultural
narratives, Elam "Burning Daylight" Harnish's story begins when he goes from
carrying mail in the Yukon [check task and place] to striking it rich on
fortuitous gold claims [I think it's more complex than this...]. His extractive
impulse leads him naturally into financial speculation and thus to the urban
centers of California, where he experiences the classic naturalist "plot of
decline" as distance from his wilderness roots takes its toll through the
drinking and inactivity it engenders. London paints a portrait of a typological
figure whose very physical being and essential character transforms as a result
of a change in his environment, and the loss is rendered in terms that are
understood historically as reflecting a change in the fundamental nature of the
species. The only way for Harnish to regain his physical vitality is to abandon
a capitalist conception of land in favor of a respectful engagement with it, an
engagement that is aesthetic at the same time that it is horticultural and
ecological. Rather than extracting value from land in the form of rent, Harnish
begins to value the land itself based on its health and an autonomy that
approximates that of the wild north from which he came. But it is not wildness
itself that he values---rather, it is his relationship with the land,
a relationship that is active without being extractive, encouraging growth that
increases the productive capacity of the land whether or not what is produced
is profitable. In order to attain this state of horticultural enlightenment, he
has to come to an understanding of the influence environment has on his basic
being, or in other words of the naturalist logic of determinism that cuts right
to the genre's conception of humanness itself. When a small landslide in his
new idealized natural environment reveals a strain of gold, he feels himself
momentarily pulled back into the extractive, urban version of the human that he
has fought hard to escape. In an important symbolic moment, he covers the gold
back up, knowingly choosing an atavistic human existence to preserve himself
and his immediate environment in the same act. A dynamic relationship to
species, one that balances determinism of possible futures with a free act of
choice among those futures, is the basis of this environmental praxis.

*The Valley of the Moon* (1913) is in many ways a reprise of the themes of
*Burning Daylight* that pushes even further both the atavistic relation to
species and the resultant environmental praxis. The novel is neatly divided
between sections dealing with the city and the country, setting up a neat test
case for the naturalist urban premise of the naturalist plot of decline. Billy
and Saxon effect a flight from the city of Oakland when teamster union strikes
are put down by zealous police violence---and because of Billy's surrender to
alcohol that is the partial result. The second half of the novel chronicles
their travels in search of a plot of land, which they idealize by imagining as
a "valley of the moon," otherworldly and perhaps unattainable. [check? where
does the valley of the moon thing begin?] On the way to finding this land,
a clear proxy for London's own "Beauty Ranch," Billy and Saxon gather
horticultural knowledge from a combination of farming operations owned and
managed by immigrant communities, market gardeners with upscale clientele, and
a set of books and pamphlets that represent a cross-section of London's own
Beauty Ranch horticultural library.[^ln-tichi] Putting this collected wisdom
into practice has an effect on Billy and Saxon similar to what Elam Harnish
experiences in *Burning Daylight*: they settle into a hard-working but
unalienated routine of agricultural labor and living, having escaped the
degrading influence of urbanity. Billy and Saxon's story follows a "back-to-the
land" motif that is built on the naturalist logic of determinism and decline
while complicating that logic at the same time. Conceding a degree of
environmental determinism, at least as far as the broad categories of rural and
urban environments, the pair nevertheless have a degree of choice in choosing
a new environment and in transforming the environment they find themselves
in---which transformation is possible to a much greater degree beyond the dense
and alienated environment of the city. 

[^ln-tichi]: citation in Tichi's book on London as reformer


For Billy and Saxon, choosing among possible environments and, by extension,
possible modes of being also entails choosing how to relate to their forebears.
They experience a more voluntary form of the atavism of *Before Adam*: where
*BA*'s protagonist unwittingly exceeds the boundaries of individual experience,
Billy and Saxon seek out a consciousness that exceeds themselves and the
timescale of the individual. They willfully change their environment and their
relation to it only after understanding themselves in terms of their forebears
and of broader historical action. In the first place, they understand their
exploration of California in search of land as an extension of their family
history several generations back. [quotes] But this broadening of the self goes
back even further, into a shared fantasy of a seafaring past through which they
understand their own nomadic existence. [quotes] 

Finally, these attempts to connect with personal family histories, real or
imagined, coincide with an understanding of the land itself not as it is, but
as a process resulting in its current state. Billy and Saxon (especially Saxon)
see the conventional wisdom of California farmers gone badly awry, represented
most succinctly by a farmer who brags about how many plots of land he has
single-handedly exhausted. They also see in the larger environmental history of
the country this same short-sightedness, an agricultural mode oriented to
building cities by stripping the countrysides with no thought given to
maintaining the soil. In other words, they discover that the same forces that
produced the environment from which they fled have also looted the Arcadia they
hoped to find. Their atavism gives them a counterpoint, a second comparative
perspective with which they can see the destruction wrought by too great
a degree of human influence on our environment. The wider view they gain
ultimately allows them to make a different choice. Rejecting the trend, they
begin systematically building the soil on first one farm, then several in the
Sonoma Valley. The novel concludes with Saxon becoming pregnant, something they
worried would not be possible after their travails in the city led to
a miscarriage. This ending establishes a clear symbolic link (albeit
a troubling one from an ecofeminist perspective) between their integration into
a larger narrative of heredity and species and the discovery of an alternative
to environmental destruction. 




This chapter will explore the ways in which literary naturalism, and
particularly the works of Jack London, has already taken up one of the chief
heuristic challenges posed by the Anthropocene as a theoretical discourse: to
consider the place of natural history in human history by conceiving of the
human *as a species*.
