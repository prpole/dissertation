### Introduction: *Before Adam* and the Geological Human

Jack London's *Before Adam* (1906-7) begins with a peculiar act of geological
periodization. It comes shortly after he establishes his motif, with the
novel's unnamed narrator explaining that his life has been plagued by the
scattered, intrusive memories of "Big-Tooth," a distant, pre-human progenitor.
The object of this periodization is not part of the stratigraphic record, the
layers of mineral sedimentation that make up the inorganic archive of the
planet. Rather, it is the experiences and memories of the narrator himself,
dated on a geological timescale:

> My nights marked the reign of fear---and such fear!...[M]y fear is the fear
of long ago, the fear that was rampant in the Younger World, and in the youth
of the Younger World. In short, the fear that reigned supreme in that period
known as the Mid-Pleistocene. (1)

We are asked, from the beginning, to understand this man's experience in terms
well beyond the boundaries of his own life, or even the lives of several
generations. We are instead asked to place his visceral fear in a context that
defies the capacities of individual experience---told that in order to
understand it, we have to not only think but feel, as he is forced to, across
the temporal poles that define the ambit of the human species as a whole. The
site of London's geological archive becomes the periodizing consciousness
itself, which has gained access to the accreted layers of memory that make up
its identity---an identity that in turn encompasses far more than a sum of
individual experiences. 

Jack London's geology, in short, is a geology of the human, a geology in which
the human is both the subject and object of study. A century later, we have
a name for this geology: the Anthropocene. This chapter will explore the ways
Jack London uses the narrative techniques of naturalism to represent the
experience of species as such, taking a natural-historical category that
touches the geological timescale as the basis of an idealized human collective.
Focusing particularly on his well known short story "To Build a Fire" (1908)
and the less prominent agricultural novel *The Valley of the Moon* (1915), this
exploration will ultimately suggest that London had preemptively taken up one
of the chief heuristic challenges posed by the Anthropocene as a theoretical
discourse almost a century before that discourse began: to consider the place
of natural history in human history (and vice versa) by expanding the temporal
scope of what constitutes "human history", rendering the human species itself
as an identity that is able to be experienced as such, and using this
experience of species as a way to understand the role of the human in the long
history of the planet. 

In pursuing this argument, I will explore commonalities in the formal
techniques that London uses across these works to narrate the human identity
from without, particularly his use of typological characters to make the
individual subjectivity stand in for a collective and the way he creates distance between
the narrator and the subjectivity of the protagonist to identify
certain experiences as indicative of the species as a whole. But I will also
confront the difficulty of separating London's confused perspectives on race
with his attempts to think through species as a defining category. Finally,
I will show that London takes the narration of species experience that he
developed over the course of his best-known work and extends it to an analysis
of the detrimental influence of human activity on the planet in his late
agricultural novels (and in his life on the experimental ranch that inspired
them). In short, an understanding of the human based on the geological
timescale is a basis for London's understanding of what causes extensive
environmental destruction, but taking the human species as a foundation for
positive collective action is also his starting point for remediation.

---

And yet, thinking the human geologically as London does has until recently
constituted a category error. The human is mere biology, and we had thus (until
the discovery of the Anthropocene) been assumed to interact with other
lifeforms and our immediate environment without so much as scratching the
surface of the geological record. What the designation of the Anthropocene
recognizes, however, is that despite being barely more than a footnote in the
long history of the Earth, the human has now ascended to the scale
of a geological force that could well define that planet's future, leaving many
and various stratigraphic footprints as we unwittingly alter the most basic
systems of our natural
environment. Attempts to confront the Anthropocene, whether
conceptually or practically, have found in this most basic premise
a considerable stumbling block because of its reliance on an uncomplicated
universal "human", or "Anthropos". To act in recognition that the human collective has become
a geological force, one has to first experience oneself as fundamentally part
of that human collective---not even biologically or geologically, but as part
of an identity that precedes and exceeds the intellect and the individual.
Whether this is possible has been a matter of some debate, but such an
experience is precisely what many of the narrative techniques of literary
naturalism, and Jack London's work in particular, attempt to induce.

<!--s-b-->We can name the thing London seeks to depict "species-being,"
adopting the Marxian term for a similar concept. In the Marxian framework to which London subscribed, capitalism engenders a
constant and conscious revolutionization of the means of production, as a
consequence of which "all that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is
profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real
conditions of life, and his relations with his kind."[@marxmanifesto...]
Under these conditions of constant change, the "real conditions of life" become both a revelation and a
teleologically mutable object, something realized individually and collectively
*through its transformation*. Species-being refers to humanity's
conscious transformation of itself in this larger context of
revolutionization, a transformation of the collective's defining nature that is 
inextricable from that of the means of production. Nature, objects, and systems
of production are simply the "inorganic body" of the human that makes this
transformative knowledge of the collective self possible.

With the heuristic challenges posed by the "Anthropos" in Anthropocene, 
species-being as a concept
has reemerged with a new resonance, now making it possible to question what
role humanness-as-such plays in the environmental crisis.[^ln-sb-reemergence]
Invoking species-being here can serve to put London at once in the
context of the Marxist theory that was central to his own thinking on a number
of topics throughout his life[^ln-london-marxism] and the aspects of the 
Anthropocene discourse he partially predicts. 

[^ln-sb-reemergence]: See e.g.: @johnson_at_2017; @roelvink_rethinking_2013;
@taylor_tennysons_2016; @wark_molecular_2015. 

[^ln-london-marxism]: See @raskin_jack_2005. 

In London's work, as in Marxist and Anthropocene theory, species-being can be
taken as the place where questions of the human, technology, and the
environment collide, becoming subject to a unified 
process of historical contingency. Such historical contingency 
separates species-being from uncomplicated essentialism. The concept of
species-being and London's narration of species both assert a degree of mutual
experience and common subjectivity across members of a species without taking that
mutuality as totally deterministic of an individual's nature.  
Just as, for Marx, transformations
in the social and technological means of production lead to corresponding
transformations in the nature of the human, London describes
developments
in species-being according to a combination of individuality and changing
socio-technological conditions, taking the Promethean symbol of fire as an
emblem of humanness and urban environments as sites of catastrophic alienation
from self and species alike. Insofar as human species-being itself is
responsible for the existential threat to the planet, it will not be due to
some immutable essence in this framework, but rather the result of historical
developments in the abilities and characteristics that define us.

Considered in terms of humanity's relationship to our natural environment,
species-being can both be grounds for a critique of the human's role in 
environmental history and the basis of
a mobilization. As an historically contingent essence, species-being adopts
technological development and industrialization (common targets of
environmentalist critique) as defining aspects of what it means to be
human---or to be more precise, as features of what it has meant to be human at
certain moments in an extremely *longue-durée* history. This association in turn
forces us to ask whether it is humanness itself that is responsible for the
environmental damage occasioned by, for example, the industrial revolution, or 
something else (like capitalism or technological development).
Such a proposition might seem to be a particularly cynical determinism, but at 
the same time an ability to conceive of environmental change in terms of the species itself is
the first step in any suitable response to the crisis that is implied by and
that gave rise to the term "Anthropocene", because nothing less than a 
global remediation of the trends that led to this point will be enough to prevent 
catastrophic change.

If a conception of the human species is necessary to mobilize for change at the necessary
scale, it is also true that this new conception of species is only possible within
reach of this self-inflicted threat to our existence as a species. Indeed, it may
be that the "Anthropos" in Anthropocene is always already on the verge of extinction
at its own hand. Although technically only
designating a geological epoch defined by the influence of collective human
activity, the Anthropocene has always been more than a passive marker of
a temporal boundary,
even in its earliest instantiations serving as shorthand at once for anthropogenic 
destruction of the planet and the need for immediate
remediation.[@crutzen_geology_2002, @crutzen_anthropocene_2006] Reviving the
"human species" as a universalizing concept offers both an explanation of this
destruction and a response to it. Indeed, as Dipesh Chakrabarty puts it in his
seminal essay "The Climate of History: Four Theses," "Species may indeed be the
name of a placeholder for an emergent, new universal history of humans that
flashes up in the moment of the danger that is climate change."[^ln-chak-ndw]
If our "moment of danger" is causing us to reach for the species concept,
a biological collective that both exceeds and composes the individual, it is in
response to a dual relationship to mass extinction. We recognize that the human
collective has become a destructive force by its very nature, but we recognize
at the same time that this destructiveness does not come with omnipotence. To
think of the human in a superhuman timescale is to take seriously the threat of
self-inflicted species death and place ourselves in the long history of
lifeforms coming into being and disappearing in a geological moment. 

[^ln-chak-ndw]: @chakrabarty_climate_2009 221. Nick Dyer-Witheford also picks
up on this Benjaminian resonance: @dyer-witheford_1844/2004/2044:_2004 5.

*Before Adam* ends on a similar note of ephemerality, of individual and species
alike, defined by equally imminent senses of the species' coming-to-be and its 
extinction. The Folk, after all, do not survive to
become human. Though we don't know their fate for certain, it is clear that
they are so diminished as to form barely a hereditary trace in the makeup of
the modern human compared to the dominant Fire People, a mere eddy in the gene
pool. Reflecting on the moment when the few surviving Folk assemble after being
routed by the Fire People, the narrator says, "It is like the meeting of the
handful of survivors after the day of the end of the
world."[@london_before_2000 235] As he would again in *The Scarlet Plague*
(1912), a post-apocalyptic novel in which a plague wipes out all but a small
community of survivors who revert to primitive ways of living, London invokes
the end of the world as an occasion to consider the fragility of humanity as
a whole.

For London and contemporary thinkers of the Anthropocene alike, ephemerality
also leads to a more poignant experience of a species identity primarily by
taking the species as a form of community in itself. In this moment of threat,
the narrator, speaking for Big-Tooth, subtly changes his focus from the limited
perspective of Big-Tooth's own experiences to the fortunes of the collective,
speaking for both Big-Tooth and the species he represents. The usual subject
"I" becomes a "we" as the Folk are hounded to the edges of habitable land. "We
could not survive in such an environment," the narrator says, and "the radical
change in our diet was not good for us...[w]e were all lean and
dyspeptic-looking."[@london_before_2000 237] The narrator draws attention to
the effects of a changed environment on he Folk, and by extension to the
relatively particular conditions they need to survive. This becomes, in effect,
an analysis of the species from within, for the rapidly dwindling species is
composed only of those present. Speaking for a species is possible in
conditions where it is the same as speaking for a community. Births and deaths
in this species-community, for example, take on a new significance. When he
says that "we died faster than new ones were born" and "our number steadily
diminished," it is understood to be an existential threat to the species as
a whole. This threat in turn leads to a meditation on the nature of the human
itself: "I, the modern, am incontestably a man," we are told; "yet I,
Big-Tooth, the primitive, am not a man. Somewhere, and by straight line of
descent, these two parties to my dual personality were connected. Were the
Folk, before their destruction, in the process of becoming men?...I do not
know."[@london_before_2000 241] Understanding the species-identity of the pre-human "Folk" is
possible in a way that, to the narrator, the identity of the modern human
simply is not. London provides the possibility of a species experience in the
Folk before creating a speculative gap that invites meditation on the
experience of modern humanity in the same terms he sets out for the Folk.

He is not alone in this simultaneous acknowledgement of the need to think about
the human collective and hesitation to think about the human species in the
same way we think of non- or pre-human species. Though the human species is
a universalizing concept that, as Chakrabarty puts it, "flashes up" in an
existentially threatening moment, it inhabits a timescale that would seem to be
too far removed from that of human experience to be easily apprehensible---or,
for that matter, apprehensible at all in any experiential sense. It is
Chakrabarty himself who has most influentially voiced this impossibility: 

> Who is the we? We humans never experience ourselves as a species. We can only
intellectually comprehend or infer the existence of the human species but never
experience it as such. There could be no phenomenology of us as a species. Even
if we were to emotionally identify with a word like mankind, we would not know
what being a species is, for, in species history, humans are only an instance
of the concept species as indeed would be any other life form. But one never
experiences being a concept.[@chakrabarty_climate_2009 220]

We may be able to conceive of the totality, and we may be able to experience it
as a kind of guilt on behalf of that totality. But the phenomenological gap
between self and species is too large: species may be always already embodied,
but it is not able to be lived except conceptually, or intellectually. The
Anthropocene thus presents a moment of crisis in the individual imagination.
Thinking our new epoch requires that the individual experience be expanded even
further beyond the self than what normal historical consciousness requires,
a collectivizing act that is less identification with something larger than 
interrogation of an identity that is both *a priori* and embodied. 

---

Herein, of course, lies the great danger of species-thinking as a theoretical
program. It risks ignoring half a century of critical theory, the very basis of
which is opposition to the kind of essentialism a discourse of the human
species would seem to imply. At least in the humanities, a proliferation of
alternate terms has resulted, among them the Capitalocene,
the Plantationocene, and the Cthulucene.[@moore_capitalism_2015;
@harraway_anthropocene_2015] These searches for an alternative term have
one thing in common: they understand the "anthropos" in Anthropocene as an even
distribution of blame for actions the benefits of which have historically been
anything *but* even. <!--That Jack London invokes the species as a heuristic hardly
redeems it, and may in fact do the opposite. -->

But this understandably critical reaction to the term may well mistake one type
of universal for another, or at least apply to it a historiographic method that
searches for an ethical and economic accounting when the term's argument is
first and foremost about the capacities of an organism considered in
natural-historical terms. Ian Baucom, sharing the concerns that cause this
discomfort as he considers Chakrabarty's version of the universal species
concept, points out that the Anthropocene's universalism "seems to wreak havoc
on the key principles of historical understanding and political commitment that
have animated not only Chakrabarty's preceding body of work, but the broader
project of postcolonial critique to which that work has been dedicated."
[-@baucom_human_2012 3] But to consider the species concept as a universal of
the same type as those that postcolonial critique has opposed in the past,
Baucom continues, would be to miss Chakrabarty's point. It is not the
universalism that has been widely opposed in the name of a struggle for the
"freedom of difference," but a "natural--scientific" universalism that presents
a new paradigm entirely.[-@baucom_human_2012 3] As Baucom reads it, in this new
paradigm "freedom can no longer be conceived of as the freedom of difference
against the power of the globalizing same." Rather, "freedom" now relies on
survival through a collective effort to save the planet by transforming our
relationship to it, and this universal concept becomes a requirement of freedom
itself. The pursuit of freedom is now "a task of the species, as species, for
the species. It is a universal human challenge, a challenge of humanity's
shared natural history and its shared planetary future."[-@baucom_human_2012 3]
Baucom shifts the universalizing gesture of the "anthropos" prefix onto the
commonality of a deep past and the preservation of an equally deep future (one
hopes), temporalities that fall beyond the scope of historiographies of the
human scale. Doing so makes the human species a collectivizing gesture that
attempts to encompass everyone without asking for homogeneity. As Gerda
Roelvink puts it, "Species, then, might refer to a kind of political
collectivity without essence."[@roelvink_rethinking_2013 54]

The problem of species, of the "*anthropos*" in the Anthropocene, is thus
multifaceted and beset with contradictions. It demands a natural-scientific
universalism that takes the species concept as the basis for human history and
as the starting point in the struggle for freedom. It requires an understanding
of anthropogenic planetary change based on this species history. But in
developing such a species history, we risk backsliding into the essentialisms
of the past, and thus a concerted effort must be made to differentiate
a natural-scientific universalism of collective survival from the universals of
the past that have long been used to justify programs of domination and
exploitation. 

And yet over all these tasks hovers an enduring paradox: to address the
conceptual and practical challenges of the Anthropocene, we must embrace
a concept that Chakrabarty claims fundamentally exceeds the capacities of human
experience, that has no phenomenology, that is somehow both embodied and
inaccessible.

---

Though differently framed, the defining questions and formal characteristics of
literary naturalism speak directly to this set of concerns. In pursuing the
well-trodden ground of the "determinism" question in literary naturalism,
critics of the genre have debated the role of species characteristics in
determining the actions and experiences of the individual. The naturalist
character is, famously or notoriously, less notable as an individual
subjectivity than as a nexus of warring deterministic forces. The most marked
conflicts occur between "forces" defined by evolutionary conditioning and those
that are a product of a physical and social environment, especially in the
context of urban environments.[^ln-norris-examples]

[^ln-norris-examples]: DRAFT NOTE - I hope to circle back to this and broaden
the context of species and determinism with a brief discussion of Frank Norris. 

Introducing the species concept into this discourse merely requires a reminder
that speciation is the product of evolutionary variation. But when this common
reading of the naturalist character is recast not just in terms of the species
concept, but in terms of the species concept with all the resonances it has
gained in the discourse of the Anthropocene, readings of the naturalist form
and its philosophical underpinnings alike gain added significance. In treating
characters as more than individual subjectivities, as typological figures and
as products of biological and environmental conditions instead, the narrative
strategies unique to naturalist fiction pursue the same imaginative capacities
that are required to conceive of the species in the ways Chakrabarty says is
both necessary and impossible. 

Most notably, despite their aspirations to narrate vast systems of human and
non-human "forces", naturalist novels tend to be insistently visceral in the
descriptive details they use to compose this narration. One need only think of
Dreiser's Carrie or Wharton's Lily Bart to see how the visceral and the
systemic intertwine. Both women experience the bodily changes that result from
their gruelling labor in clothing production, a process detailed in terms that
evoke the lived experience of the labor rather than the theory of it; and yet
for both authors, the experiential serves the conceptual, establishing a window
into the alienation of labor and the economic systems that lead to
it.[^ln-dreiser-wharton] 

[^ln-dreiser-wharton]: DRAFT NOTE - Similarly, this is another place for richer
context in the genre as a whole with some specific passages from Dreiser and
Wharton. 

While these are historical rather than natural-historical examples---the
conditions of labor are historically contingent and understandable within human
timescales---the same holds true of the natural historical cases. In *Before
Adam*, the narrator's access to the memories of his deep past comes from
feeling, not from contemplation: from fear, a felt and decidedly unscientific
experience. To feel the fear of the Pleistocene epoch is to recall a distinctly
different humanity, one that has not superceded the bounds of biological agency
to become geological---indeed, one that has not yet removed itself from the
food chain or secured its sustenance through the soft conquests of agriculture
and animal domestication. London establishes the gulf between this pre-human
form and the modern human through juxtaposition of the Folk and the Fire
People. When Big-Tooth and his friend Lop-Ear stalk the Fire People and
investigate the remnants of their fire, the simplest possible moment of
dramatic irony results: "I wanted to see what [the fire] was like, and between
thumb and finger, I picked up a glowing coal. My cry of pain and fear, as
I dropped it, stampeded Lop-Ear into the trees, and his flight frightened me
after him."[@london_before_2000 165] This moment of pain and fear, though
fleeting, is reminiscent of the fears of the "Mid-Pleistocene" in general that
London narrates---fears that result not from the external conditions themselves
but from the Folk's inability to confront them using the methods humanity has
developed since, like technology and community. In other words, the fear
results from being someone like Big-Tooth, who "did not bother to weigh and
analyze," who "was simplicity itself" and "just lived events, without ever
pondering why he lived them in his particular and often erratic way."
[@london_before_2000 137] In imagining not knowing that fire will burn---or not
knowing how to use weapons to fight predators, or not knowing to band together
to resist a larger enemy---the modern reader must imagine a consciousness
without the same type of problem-solving, tool-use, and social capacities that
so define human history.[^ln-before-note-dumb] But the entry point to this
consciousness is the shared visceral feelings of pain an fear.

[^ln-before-note-dumb]: It is clear from London's notes for *Before Adam* that
this was an intentional effect: ""He once found broken gourd, filled with
rain-water, drank it, but never thought to use gourd.---He (modern) often
watched to see what he (primitive) would do, & he (modern) often vexed
& perturbed by foolishness, illogic, obtusity, etc., of him
(primitive)"[@london_jack_1916 JL507]


Where Chakrabarty claims that "one never experiences being a concept", London
attempts to use common feeling as a bridge to an experience of species-being.
To recall this earlier state of being in the context of evolutionary history is
to draw the outline of the human species history through an experiential link
between early and late temporal poles. The result is not an abstract conception
but a comparison of ways of being that encompasses a multi-epochal humanness. 

The rest of this chapter will take three of London's works as case studies to
show that his engagement with the species concept culminated in an attempt to
use species-being as the basis of a unified pursuit of a single principle,
increasing the abundance of life on Earth. First, I will discuss "To Build
a Fire" to show how he used non-human perspectives to theorize species-being.
The next, brief section will show how London develops a speculative version of
future possible species-beings in a late, relatively unknown play called
*The Acorn-Planter*. Finally, I will argue through a reading of *The Valley of
the Moon* that in order to imagine his vision of species-being enacted
practically, London was forced to confront the nativist and supremacist
convictions of his moment---convictions that he himself voices at some moments
in his work and opposes at others. What results is a progressive agrarianism in
which scientific agriculture and cultural exchange realize his vision of the
potential for an ecological species-being.

### "To Build a Fire": Species-Being, Human and Animal

> ...humankind is self-made in the most literal sense. Our bodies are the
product of the tool-using adaptation which predates the genus *Homo*. We
actively determined our design through tools that mediate the human exchange
with nature. This condition of our existence may be visualized in two
contradictory ways. Gazing at the tools themselves, we may choose to forget
that they only mediate our labor. From that perspective, we see our brains and
our other products impelling us on a historical course of escalating
technological domination; that is, we build an alienated relation to nature.
We see our specific historical edifice as both inevitable human nature and
technical necessity. [...] Or, we may focus on the labour process itself and
reconstruct our sense of nature, origins, and the past so that the human future
is in our hands.

> ---Donna J. Haraway, *Simians, Cyborgs, and Women* [22]

It is somewhat surprising, given his systematic pursuit of a way to narrate the
human as such, that Jack London is more commonly associated with his depiction
of non-human subjects. Indeed, the works in London's *oeuvre* that are most
obviously relevant to the species discussion are also those for which he is
most famous: his "dog stories", as he liked to call them. In *The Call of the
Wild* (1903) and *White Fang* (1906), he uses the perspective of two canine
protagonists to explore the line between domesticity and wildness. The
protagonist of the former, Buck, becomes progressively wilder as he moves from
a comfortable existence on a farm to leading a sled team to running free with
a pack of wolves. The latter, *White Fang*, presents an inverse situation,
tracing its eponymous character's life from his birth in the wilderness through
his coming of age in captivity, where he pulls sleds and is forced to fight in
a dogfighting circuit until he is rescued and finally domesticated. 

But London's dog stories are ironically as much about humanity as they are
about non-human animals. The individual dog character offers London a lens to
explore not only the subjectivity of dogs, however, but the subjective
experience of species more broadly writ. On one hand, he does consider the
degree to which the experience of a single dog is the result of its inherent
dogness---that is, to what extent species itself can be said to account for
individual subjectivity. On the other hand, he uses the dog figure as
a mechanism of narrative estrangement, a vantage point from to consider the
human *from without*, and from which to ask whether humanness can be used to
define the individual human in the same way that he thought dogness can define
the individual dog. 


The question was already controversial when he first posed it at the beginning
of the twentieth century. Even where his conclusions appeared to be limited to
actual dogs, interrogating species as such made trouble for London, involving
him in a controversy regarding so-called "nature-fakers" and pitting him
against none other than the sitting president and self-appointed authority on
all things out-of-doors, Theodore Roosevelt. The controversy began when
a scientist named John Burroughs wrote an article called "Real and Sham Natural
History," in which he decried the appearance of sympathetic and above all
individualistic animal characters in the fiction of the day. Burroughs claimed
that all animal behavior is entirely instinctual, and that the imputation of
reason and learned behavior to individual animals, a premise on which he
claimed these animal
fictions relied, constituted nature-fakery. To Burroughs, the non-human animal
is entirely mechanistic, an automaton driven by pure instinct. For his
part, Roosevelt leveled petty complaints against *White Fang*: he saw fakery in
the claim that a lynx could kill a dog (a claim, incidentally, which does not
appear in *White Fang*, as London would later point out) and that a bull dog
could beat a wolf dog in a fight.[@london_other_1910] Narrating a theory of
species brought London to a fight of his own---one which he did not necessarily
relish---about the degree of determinism and universalization implied by the
species concept.

When these critiques began to appear, London did his best to keep out of it. As
he wrote several years later of the incident in an essay called "The Other
Animals": "when the word *nature-faker* was coined, I, for one, climbed into my
tree and stayed there...and a Honolulu reporter elicited the sentiment from me
that I thanked God I was not an authority on anything." [@london_other_1910 237]
When he finally did climb down from his tree, he dismissed Roosevelt's claims
easily enough, describing the president as an "amateur" and saying he "does not
understand evolution, and he does not seem to have made much of an attempt to
understand evolution."[@london_other_1910 240-1] On this basis, he excused the
president's mistakes and suggested a more careful rereading of the works
Roosevelt critiqued.

In responding to Burroughs, London was more comprehensive and more damning, and
in the process revealed a continuity between his dog books and his meditations
on the human. In "The Other Animals," he recounts several experiences with his
own dogs that bear a clear relation to episodes in his fiction, analyzing them
to demonstrate reason triumphing over instinct in the non-human subject. The
drives of instinct and reason, he says, come out of an evolutionary succession,
with the former a "race-habit" that "is blind, unreasoning, mechanical" and the
latter a development that culiminates in, but is not exlusive to, humanness
itself.[@london_other_1910 262] His concluding salvo continues to place human
and non-human on an evolutionary continuum, but in doing so also suggests
that pre-human natural history continues to exist in the humans of
the present:

> Mr. Burroughs, though you stand on the top of the ladder of life, you must
not kick out that ladder from under your feet. You must not deny your
relatives, the other animals. Their history is your history....What you
repudiate in them you repudiate in yourself — a pretty spectacle, truly, of an
exalted animal striving to disown the stuff of life out of which it is made,
striving by use of the very reason that was developed by evolution to deny the
processes of evolution that developed it. This may be good egotism, but it is
not good science.[@london_other_1910 265-6]

Embrace the animal, London tells us, "exalted animal" though it may be.
Claiming that human action is driven exclusively by reason contradicts the very
conclusions of that reason, which require an admission of *unreason* in the
form of atavistic drives. Contrary to the straw-man versions of naturalist
determinism that have defined many critiques of the genre for over a century,
animalistic drives in the human and non-human alike are non-mechanistic in
London's view. Rather, his naturalism positions these drives as a substratum
that exists in a complex mixture with the reason that both derives from and
seeks to disown it. The extent to which reason has developed and the sway that
it holds is a matter of speciation.

But buried in this conclusion is another telling statement that complicates the
traditional boundaries between human history and natural history---the very
boundary that Chakrabarty and Baucom say the Anthropocene itself complicates.
"You must not deny your relatives, the other animals," London tells us. He
continues: *Their history is your history*. What appears a statement of
inter-species camaraderie becomes much more when considered in terms of
London's larger project in relation to species. He uses the species concept as
a starting point for a narrative exploration of the natural history of the
human---a unique kind of historical fiction, we might say, a natural history
fiction.

*Before Adam* is undoubtedly such a fiction, an attempt to bring to life, to
bring to experience, the natural history of the human. It experiments not so
much with different temporalities as with juxtaposed modes of experience
appropriate to different forms of consciousness in the history of the species,
just as other naturalist historical novels (Dreiser's *The Financier*, for
example) create the experience of a bygone economic and social moment. But
where historical fiction and its narrative modes have a line of precedence as
long as that of literature itself, natural history fiction has many of its
fundamental questions unanswered: What does it mean to *live* species rather
than think, not as a transcendent experience but as a quotidian one? What does
it mean to experience the species as a defining category contingent on a moment
in natural history, in the way that certain historically contingent identities
can be experienced?

---

If *Before Adam* fails to address these questions, it is perhaps because it
fails to root itself in the experiences of either of the two moments it
depicts, fully inhabiting the experience of neither the Pleistocene nor the
Holocene. It may model a natural-historical fiction, but this fiction has
merely the same narrative requirements as other forms of historical fiction. If
he makes the pre-human experience of the Pleistocene more accessible to
a modern consciousness, it may paint a clearer sketch of the process of
speciation and human development, in the same way that Dreiser opens the
economic crisis of the 1870s to experience to form an argument about the
crisis-prone nature of capitalism and finance. But neither novel does anything
to expand the temporal scale of their narration within its own bounds,
a expansion without which any robust experience of species remains out of
reach. 

In a short story from the same period, "To Build a Fire," London performs just
such an expansion through the classic naturalist
tropes of atavism and instinct, narrating a human experience in which multiple
temporalities exist at once. In doing so, he also presents a version of
the human that exceeds the category of biological species in the nature of its
interaction with its environment---and through
contrast with a canine character like those of *The Call of the Wild* and
*White Fang*, he shows just how much the species-concept needs to be revised to be
experienced on human terms. The story tests the ways the forms of knowledge
that came to conflict in the "nature fakers" controversy define the experience
of species in canine and human subjects alike. It also pursues an
anti-essentialist definition of humanness as plastic and historically
contingent---a definition that effectively blends the historical and
natural-historical modes in the same manner of Marxian species-being.

What makes these meditations on the human stand out even more distinctly is the
fact that they only exist in the second of the story's two versions---the one
written after *The Call of the Wild*, *White Fang*, and *Before Adam*. "To
Build a Fire" was first published as a much shorter story in *Youth's
Companion* magazine in 1902. Shortly afterward, in 1903, *The Call of the Wild*
was published to popular acclaim, followed by *White Fang* in 1906. Only after
exploring the narrative challenges of species in canine characters did London
write *Before Adam*, which was serialized in 1906 and 1907, extending to human
characters the explorations of species that come more naturally in reference to
non-human figures. Finally, in 1908, something he had discovered in writing
these books prompted him to return to the events of "To Build a Fire" with
a much more nuanced view of the human and a much more ambitious sense of the
philosophical vision it implies.

The early story forms a clear foundation for the later, canonical version. Both
feature a man traveling alone in temperatures less than negative-sixty degrees
(contrary to the advice of more experienced travelers) whose foot becomes
soaked with water. In both, the man struggles to build a fire to dry himself
out and stay alive, fighting the absolute numbness of his extremities to light
birch-bark kindling with a book of matches. 

But there are differences in the key events as well, inviting a comparative
reading. In the earlier story, the man makes it back to camp with scars and an
education. In the latter, he dies, and his canine companion (who does not
appear in the former version) returns without him to "the other food-providers
and fire-providers."[@london_build_2001 271] Furthermore, while the protagonist
of the early story is individuated, receiving a name and thus an identity, the
protagonist of the later story is merely called "the man." This was
a deliberate omission and one that occurred early in the composition process.
In the first handwritten manuscripts, it is clear that London had given the man
a name before taking it away, writing "John Collins" and "Collins" several
times before scratching them out. "Collins" becomes a blank slate for "man",
London's preferred term for referring to the human in
general.[@london_jack_1916 JL1310]

With these changes to the events of the story come more significant
philosophical implications, particularly about how reason and technology have
come to define the very essence of the human. Broadly speaking, the story
suggests that knowledge as such forms a barrier between the individual organism
and death, laying out three forms of such knowledge: instinct, individual
reason, and socially transmitted experience. The different proportions of each
of these forms of knowledge comes to define the distinct essences of
individuals and species alike.

London is inconsistent regarding the extent to which each of these forms of
knowledge does indeed constitute knowledge. In some cases, instinct is
presented as something other than knowing. When, confronted with wet feet just
as the man is, the dog begins licking and biting its toes to break off the ice,
London draws a line between apparently automatic action and reason. The dog's
preventative measure "was a matter of instinct. To permit the ice to remain
would mean sore feet. It did not know this. It merely obeyed the mysterious
prompting that arose from the deep crypts of its being."[@london_build_2001
263] In contrast, when the man helps the dog remove the ice from its feet, he
does so not out of some coevolutionary impulse, but based on a deduced and
self-serving rationale. No, the dog did not know what the ice "meant": "But the
man knew, having achieved a judgment on the subject, and he removed the mitten
from his right hand and helped tear out the ice-particles."[@london_build_2001
263-4] Here is a familiar story about the line separating human and animal, not
unlike Burroughs's position in his excoriation of nature fakers. Where the man
"achieve[s] a judgment," the dog merely "obeys" a distinctly embodied
sedimentation of ancestral experiences. Dubbing the source of the dog's
instinctual response "the deep crypts of its being," London renders this action
as somehow dead, a stark contrast to the active language of the man's
intellectual achievements.

But this familiar argument that places the non-human on the side of instinct
and the human on the side of reason is not London's, as is clear from his
response to Burroughs, and the initial easy division is quickly complicated. In
the first place, the dog of "To Build a Fire" has all the same capacity for
reason that London saw in his own dogs and that he ascribes to Buck and White
Fang. Responding to life-threatening cold, the dog has a learned response that
appears simultaneously with his instinctive one: "The dog had learned fire, and
it wanted fire, or else to burrow under the snow and cuddle its warmth away
from the air."[@london_build_2001 262] The dog prefers the fire it has learned
to depend on, but failing that, it has a reservoir of instinct to fall back on.
The man is not so lucky. Though he singularly fails to benefit from any
instinctive knowledge, however, it is not because of a lack in the instinctual
capacities of humanity as a species---as is clear in *Before Adam*, London
ascribes the same "deep crypts of being" to humans in varying degrees. It is
instead a matter of the man's particular ancestry: "This man did not know cold.
Possibly all the generations of his ancestry had been ignorant of cold, of real
cold, of cold one hundred and seven degrees below freezing-point. But the dog
knew; all its ancestry knew, and it had inherited the
knowledge."[@london_build_2001 264] We understand by implication that things
might be different for the man---*this* man, not "man"---had his ancestors been
more acquainted with the kind of cold he confronts in the story. Furthermore,
instinct is not a mysterious prompting in this example, but a legitimate source
of knowledge. The dog "knew", and the man "did not know", because of
a difference in their access to instinctual archives. 

Finally, both the human and non-human subjects here have social relations that
act as yet another source of knowledge. London again and again observes, in
both versions of the story, that the man has not appreciated the advice of the
"old-timer on Sulpher Creek" who warned him against traveling alone, especially
in temperatures below negative-fifty degrees.[@london_build_2001 265] This,
ultimately, is the man's cardinal sin, a lack of respect for the accumulated
knowledge of those who know the extreme environment better than he does. For
just as the individual alone in an extreme environment is more fragile than in
a group, the knowledge of the individual is more fragile than collective
knowledge: subject to gaps due to a lack of both experience and so-called
instinctual impulses as well as to simple forgetfulness. Indeed, the man's
demise could well stem from having "forgotten to build a fire and thaw out"
before sitting down to eat, which it is implied would not have occurred had he
travelled with companions or taken more heed of advice.[@london_build_2001 264] 

What is more surprising is that his relationship with the dog could have
provided this social reservoir of knowledge were that relationship more
mutually supportive. The dog's instinctual reserves of wisdom are open to the
man, making (in theory if not in this case) inter-species sociality a route to
a replacement for those instinctual reserves that humanity lacks. Immediately
after drawing a sharp contrast between the man's lack of instinctual
understanding of the cold and the dog's awareness that "it was the time to lie
snug in a hole in the snow", London momentarily enters the dog's consciousness
to reveal its intentional withholding of what it knows: "there was no keen
intimacy between the dog and the man. The one was the toil-slave of the other,
and the only caresses it had ever received were the caresses of the whip-lash
and of harsh and menacing throat-sounds that threatened the whip-lash. So the
dog made no effort to communicate its apprehension to the
man."[@london_build_2001 265] Cruel treatment and exploitation are poor
substitutes for social relationships, so no transfer of information occurs. But
the idea that instinct is communicable is, in considering the species,
remarkable---because one might presume that instinctual knowledge is either
a shared *human* instinct (and does not need to be communicated) or is
inaccessible because it belongs to another species and is, *ipso facto*, unable
to communicated. London not only imagines a social life that goes beyond the
species, but suggests that such a social life is an absolute necessity for
mutual survival in certain environments.

The combination of the necessity of instinctual knowledge, the human's lack of
it, and the inter-species sociality as a replacement for it has a startling
implication in considering the fitness of humanity for survival, and indeed,
the very nature of the human. On its own, the human is incomplete, just as "the
man" as an individual is incomplete on his own in the Yukon. He needs either
the living sociality of advice and companions, discourse with the dead in the
form of a speaking archive of instinctual knowledge, or the inter-species
relationships that are enabled by domestication (or symbiosis in the case of
other species). 

To briefly summarize before moving on, then, London draws the species line
according to the availability of different types of knowledge, but he is not
absolutist in the way that Burroughs is or others are who claim that reason or
socialization uniquely define the human. Rather, London posits that the
characters of human and non-human species alike are defined by unique
combinations of these types of knowledge and the ways in which they are
determinative, or not determinative, of action. 

---

Rendering a comparative definition of species through narrative, however, is not the
same as narrating an *experience* of species as such as an identity. This is an
experience that is denied to the subjectivity of the character and induced in
the audience, through a narrative distancing similar to the one London
maintains with the double-subjectivity of *Before Adam*. "The man"
never comes to an epiphanic understanding of himself as a member of the
species, but juxtaposition with the dog becomes the narrative mechanism by
which experiences that define the human species are identified as such.
In laying out a knowledge-based theory of species, London creates his concept
of humanness; but in narrating these moments in the context of that conceptual
framework, London pursues the phenomenology of species itself.

Indeed, the first glimmer of species-thinking in the story is a rejection of
the conceptual, but the rejection itself is a telling one: in the absence of
meditation on species, there is a more direct access to the behaviors that
define London's concept of the human. Confronted with temperatures more than
fifty degrees below zero, the man is entirely unreflective:

> The trouble with him was that he was without imagination. He was quick and
alert in the things of life, but only in the things, and not in the
significances. Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty-odd degrees of frost. Such
fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did
not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and
upon man's frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits
of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural
field of immortality and man's place in the universe. [@london_build_2001 261]

What defines the man and his narrative function in the story is also the very
"trouble with him". Here London establishes the man purely as a nexus of
experience and sensation, devoid of theorization or even imagination. In the
same stroke, the narrator assigns duty of both to the reader. The scornful
negatives, the litany of all the things the man *did not* do, act as
a challenge and establish the lens through which we are to understand the
sensory data and impressions conveyed by the rest of the narrative. The human
is also removed from a place of mastery over nature, and even from a position
of uniqueness among animals, becoming a "creature of temperature"---mere
organism, contingent on certain material conditions to arise and persist. What
the man expresses as cold and discomfort we are now primed to understand as
a specimen straying outside the narrow window of habitability appropriate to
its species. And yet it still sets up a narrative emphasis on the
phenomenological, the negative statements working to establish a frame of
reference while simultaneously refusing to foreground the material out of which
that frame is composed.

The title of the story, "To Build a Fire," takes on a new significance with
this "frailty" of the species in mind, as well as the insistent centrality of
temperature in the story as a whole and this definition of the human as
a "creature of temperature" in particular. The fire serves double-duty as
a dramatic conceit and a Promethean symbol, encapsulating the human's
reliance on technology for survival by foregrounding the vulnerability
that reliance creates. But when the human is defined by the slim range of
temperatures that can support our existence, the fire comes to bear existential
weight on the level of the species. The phrase "to build a fire," an insistent
repetition throughout the story, is a statement of humanness itself in
a distinctly material sense. 

London's definition of the human by fire is one that is shared by 
scientists of the 21st century. The primatologist Richard Wrangham, for example, argues in
*Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human* that cooking increased the amount of
energy obtained from food, the effects of which not only aided in the survival
of the species, but spurred the development of humanity itself. The
energy-hungry, inefficient digestive systems of humanity's predecessors gave
way to smaller digestive systems adapted to a more efficient cooked diet while
also leading to a number of other physical adaptations like weaker
jaws;[@wrangham_catching_2009
38-41] this change in the relative costs and gains in energy is in turn thought
to have spurred brain growth.[@wrangham_catching_2009 105-6] Nor were these
adaptations limited to the human as a bounded biological agent. As their
"bodies responded by biologically adapting to cooked food" and the species, now
more resilient, spread across the planet, there were attendant ripples in the
area of the human's effects: "changes in anatomy, physiology, ecology, life
history, psychology, and society"---and, we must now add in light of the
Anthropocene, in geology. For London and Wrangham both, the development of the
human as we know it relied on the ability to exceed the boundaries of the self,
encompassing the things we use to define ourselves. "The man's" fire is thus as
defining of humanity as the winter coat is of the wolf.

<!-- interesting note from Wrangham on Darwin:

He cited his fellow evolutionist Alfred Russel Wallace approvingly: “man is
enabled through his mental faculties ‘to keep with an unchanged body in harmony
with the changing universe.’” The control of fire was just another way for an
unchanged body with an adept mental faculty to respond to a natural challenge.
“When he migrates into a colder climate he uses clothes, builds sheds, and
makes fires; and, by the aid of fire, cooks food otherwise indigestible
. . . the lower animals, on the other hand, must have their bodily structure
modified in order to survive under greatly changed conditions.” (21)

-->

<!-- technology and prosthesis stuff, appendages, tobacco beard, birch,
etc.-->Consistent with its function as a Promethean symbol, fire in London's
story is merely the representative example of the technological appendages that
come to define the very essence of the human. The most direct example of this
trend is also the story's most ambiguous and least appealing. The man chews
tobacco as he travels, but his frozen beard and numbed lips cause his spit to
accumulate in his beard and freeze: "The result was that a crystal beard of the
color and solidity of amber was increasing its length on his chin. If he fell
down it would shatter itself, like glass, into brittle fragments. But he did
not mind the appendage."[@london_build_2001 262] The man's reliance on
processed tobacco alters his physical being, making him into a strange hybrid
of his natural being and the things he makes use of. But this extra-natural
appendage is fragile by nature, and it is hardly introduced before we are
supplied with the image of its shattering. This would be no tragedy, the amber
beard conferring no imaginable advantage, but other, more common appendages are
presented as complementary prosthetics to make up for the natural protections
the human lacks. Although "he was a warm-whiskered man," for example, "the hair
on his face did not protect the high cheek-bones," and the man therefore has to
continually agitate "his numb nose and cheek-bones with his mittened
hand."[@london_build_2001 261] He eventually comes to execute this process
"automatically," putting it in the unthinking realm of natural or instinctual
action while simultaneously describing it with the lexicon of industrial
technology.[@london_build_2001 262] Even this appendage is not incorporated
firmly enough into the man's being, however, still requiring a certain degree
of attention. He notes with "a pang of regret that he had not devised
a nose-strap of the sort Bud wore in cold snaps. Such a strap passed across the
cheeks, as well, and saved them."[@london_build_2001 263] Lacking a natural
protection for his cheeks against the cold, the man's best hope of survival is
to change his very being with increasingly refined appendages, replacing the
natural with the technological. 

While these appendages, like the fire, remain external, they are nonetheless
constitutive of a human essence---if not as individual prosthetics, then as the
process of prosthesis. As Darwin himself put it, "man is enabled through his
mental faculties 'to keep with an unchanged body in harmony with the changing
universe'", which is achieved when "he uses clothes, builds sheds, and makes
fires"---whereas non-human animals "must have their bodily structure modified
in order to survive under greatly changed conditions."[Qtd. in
@wrangham_catching_2009 10] The uniquely human strategies for survival,
which in the eyes of the evolutionist (professional or amateur) are coextensive
with the defining human character, are contingent on the degree of
technological adaptation in response to a changing environment.

But technology's role in this story is hardly that of an uncomplicated savior.
London goes beyond a purely salutary view of the technological human, beyond an
account in which the human as an intelligent mind fills the gaps of the human
as an organism. The fragility of the tobacco-beard, which shatters under the
least pressure, is symbolic of humanity's over-reliance on technology for
survival. One metaphor, appearing twice near the end of the story, drives this
association home particularly clearly. As the man begins to lose sensation in
his fingers, the metaphor that recommends itself is a technological one, just
as when the man "automatically" rubbed his cheeks with his mittened hands. But
now it is with a sense of fragility that touches the basic makeup of the man's
body: "When he touched a twig, he had to look and see whether or not he had
hold of it. The *wires were pretty well down* between him and his finger-ends";
and again, "he closed [his fingers]---that is, he willed to close them, for
*the wires were down*, and the fingers did not obey."[@london_build_2001 268,
emphasis mine.] The intervention of this technological metaphor marks the man's
loss of contact with his own body, an ultimate separation of mental and
corporeal being made manifest by the dissolution of the body while the mind
remains active. Whereas earlier the technological appendages appeared as
supplements, they are now barriers between the man's consciousness and his
physical self---between the individual intellect and the more basic substratum
of being that is determined by species. The loss of a connection between the
mind and body comes to symbolize the loss of a connection between the
human intellect and the human species.

Finally, this lost connection has a greater cosmic significance than the death
of an individual character. To London, it means a loss of the connection
between humanity and our natural environment. In another telling repetition,
London suggests that our connection with the planet is bodily rather than
intellectual: "He glanced down at first in order to assure himself that he was
really standing up, for the absence of sensation in his feet left him
*unrelated to the earth*"; and on the next page, as the man runs on feet that
are entirely numb, "He seemed to himself to skim along above the surface, and
to have *no connection with the earth*."[@london_build_2001 269-70, emphasis
mine.] The statement would draw attention even without repetition, but as when
he discusses the "wires" being down, London appears unwilling to let this idea
go unnoticed. In both cases, consciousness itself is not enough for
a meaningful relationship to one's immediate environment, and this fact appears
to be much of what makes the man's disembodiment difficult for him to come to
terms with. But London's phrasing here suggests a broader interpretation than
one of mere disorientation, a reading that encompasses capital-E-Earth as well
as the simpler earth-as-ground that forms the man's point of reference. The
loss of contact with one's body, the suggestion that the human is pure
consciousness without a meaningful physical being, means the loss of
perspective regarding the human's place in the larger collage of planetary
systems, including the interrelation of species (like the communication between
man and dog) and effects on the environment more broadly conceived. 

This body-planet connection is dramatically evoked in a passage that broadens the
man's conception of his place in the universe even further. 

> His pace of four miles an hour had kept his heart pumping blood to the
surface of his body and to all the extremities. But the instant he stopped, the
action of the pump eased down. The cold of space smote the unprotected tip of
the planet, and he, being on that unprotected tip, received the full force of
the blow. The blood of his body recoiled before it. The blood was alive, like
the dog, and like the dog it wanted to hide away and cover itself up from the
fearful cold.[@london_build_2001 266]

The effect of this stunning passage relies on a juxtaposition of scales about
as violent as it is possible to achieve, from the interior of the human body in
one sentence to the movement of astral bodies in the next. As the first
sentence depicts the slowing of a single organ, the second takes its vantage
from a point beyond the planet itself, depicting the man's deadly loss of heat
in terms of the entire sum of the material systems that have caused it. Just as
the dog provides an occasional perspective from beyond the human species, this
passage makes itself exterior to the Earth. The man's insignificance is driven
home by the vastness of the universe in which he exists even as he is rendered
a part of that universe, one event in a larger chain of causality. In the
moment following this mechanistic description of freezing, the narration turns
to the purely bodily, imagining human biology as an agent unto itself. This
pure physicality, "the blood", reacts mechanistically, and this mechanism is
related to the dog's prompting from the "crypts" of accreted instinctual
knowledge. Even as the man remains unaware of the desires and actions of his
physical being, these desires are the source of connection to both the
immediate and the cosmic environment, which, with the right frame of reference,
are one and the same. To lose one's connection to the body through
technological interventions is to lose all frames of reference beyond the self,
to lose the sense of the universal in the individual.

"To Build a Fire", then, is finally an exploration of the way an ever more
technologically mediated essence changes the place of the human in all possible
environments, from the most immediate (the relationship with the dog) to the
most distant (the place on the planet as a whole). But regarding London's
conception of the species as such, and the notion of an essential species
experience, this conclusion raises more questions than it answers. Chief among
them: How is it possible for the fundamental characteristic of a species to be
defined by technology, something that is historically contingent and external?
And what, then, is the proper context in which to seek an understanding of the
human species---history or natural history? Finally, how is it possible for the
so-called "natural" being of the human to create a separation between the self
and the environment in which the self exists?

---

The questions raised by London's dog stories speak directly to some of the most
debated topics in literary naturalism and Anthropocene theory alike. To narrate
a dog experiencing its inherent species-nature, its dogness, is to narrate the
phenomenology of determinism itself, or in other words to try to capture the
feeling of responding to naturalist "forces" that dictate behavior below the
level of conscious choice. Furthermore, splitting the hairs that distinguish
the sub-species of the domestic dog from the wolf, *Canis lupus familiaris*
from *Canis lupus*, lends a lupine analogue to the naturalist preoccupation
with environmental determinism in the city and the country, respectively. The
dog character, as is especially evident in a story so dependent on
inter-species relationships, is a testing ground for a theory of the human in which our
defining humanity arises out of a deterministic, bestial base. By this
strategy, London also encounters the complicated universalization of species
discourse, which, as has already been seen, is among the first problems the
Anthropocene raises for the humanities: to consider the human and the dog in
the same terms, one must ask if they have the same relation to species as
a collectivizing principle, and what species even means in an ontological sense
when the object of contemplation is not *Canis lupus* but *Homo sapiens*. 

"To Build a Fire" on its own shows that, for London, species is not an 
identical concept when applied to humans and non-humans, nor is it an 
identical phenomenal experience. The distinction he draws between
a human and non-human species can be closely described by
the Marxian concept of species-being, a term whose very composition seems to
challenge Chakrabarty's contention that the species is not able to be
experienced except intellectually. 

Developed in *The Economic and Philosophical
Manuscripts of 1844* and largely abandoned thereafter, species-being refers to the
human's simultaneous transformation of the self and environment through
conscious production on a scale that exceeds the individual.[^ln-gilman] On one hand, 
then, species-being refers to "the historical possibilities of 
self-development" [@dyer-witheford_1844/2004/2044:_2004 4]. On the other hand, "To be 
human, for Marx, was to remake: to unsettle and reshape the whole of the 
world."[@johnson_at_2017 277] The two 
propositions amount to the same thing, because in Marxian species-being,
humanity develops its environment as a way of developing 
itself.[^ln-hegel] Species-being thus posits a uniquely human capacity to define
the nature of the individual and the collective through the transformation of
external entities: objects, the environment, and social
relations.[@johnson_at_2017 277] 

[^ln-gilman]: In this sense, the concept of species-being forms a link, and a
somewhat surprising one, between the vision of the human seen in the work of
Charlotte Perkins Gilman (see chapter three).

[^ln-hegel]: Though Marx takes the term species-being from Feuerbach and some
of its implications, this aspect of his concept builds explicitly on the 
Hegelian view of labor. Just as in Hegel's struggle of the lord and bondsman, 
self-consciousness comes about through the mediation of labor on an external 
object. As Marx himself puts it, Hegel "sees labour---within
abstraction---as man's *act of self-creation* and man's relation to himself as
an alien being and the manifestation of himself as an alien being as the
emergence of *species-consciousness* and *species-life*." [@marx_early_2005 395]

This combination of self-consciousness and mediation through an external
object---Marx at his most Hegelian---makes species-being a uniquely human
concept. These two factors distinguish species-being from the "species-life" of
animals, by which Marx means the defining "life-activities" that focus
primarily on the needs of reproduction and
sustenance.[@dyer-witheford_1844/2004/2044:_2004 4-6] All animals produce in pursuit of
their defining life-activity; but "Marx’s human [...] is a species that knows
itself in what it makes."[@johnson_at_2017 278] This distinction is
predicated on both a self-knowledge mediated by external objects and
a collective identity, a humanness, considered *itself* as a mutable, external
object of contemplation. This object-oriented humanism comes from Feuerbach's
original version of species-being in *The Essence of Christianity*: "Man is
nothing without an object. [...T]he object to which a subject essentially,
necessarily relates, is nothing else than this subject's own, but objective,
nature. [...] In the object which he contemplates, therefore, man becomes
acquainted with himself."[@feuerbach_essence_1854 4-5] Thus does "the man" of "To Build
a Fire" experience the loss of his faculties as downed wires: he is alienated
from the external objects by which the human species-being is defined. And
likewise, in losing contact with the manipulable materiality of a more
hospitable environment and the ability to build a fire, he loses contact with
his sense of self and his place on the planet.

This technological capacity is also inherently social, and so, by extension, is
human species-being. Marx is unequivocal on this point:

> The *human*
essence of nature exists only for the *social* man; for only here does nature
exist for him as a *bond* with other *men*, as his existence for others and
their existence for him, as the vital element of human reality…. *Society* is
therefore the perfected unity in essence of man with nature. (349)

And later: 

> "[W]hat
I create from myself I create for society, conscious of myself as a social
being. My *universal* consciousness is only the *theoretical* form of that
whose *living* form is the *real* community, society…. The individual *is* the
*social being*. His vital expression…is therefore an expression and
confirmation of *social life*." (350)

This link of sociality with the "human essence of nature" echoes with the
regretful meditations of London's man on breaking his social bonds, as he
laments ignoring the communal wisdom passed on by the old man and traveling
alone. But it also helps make sense of the man's loss of sociability with his
loss of a vital correspondence with the non-human world around him. In
rejecting social life, he rejects his own "vital expression," and in turn, his
very vitality. 

If the "species" is, for the human, bound up in technological objects and
social life, it is also subject to change in the course of both social and
technological history. So it is for London, as well: the dramatic separation of
the narrator and Big-Tooth in *Before Adam* is a difference of technologically
and socially mediated species-beings. The narrator's frustration at Big-Tooth's
mistakes finds focus in his pre-human inability to understand fire and the
failure of the Folk to band together in any form of social organization that
could resist their enemies and predators. Similarly, the Fire People and the
Folk, providing glimpses of different stages in the development of the human,
are defined against each other by their capacities in both of these areas. 

While these are arguably differences across different species---the Folk 
and even the Fire people being not-quite-human---in Marx's view, the same
kinds of difference develop across different degrees of social and 
technological *human* history: species has a mutable meaning even within 
a scientific designation of the human. Expanding his inquiry from the
external object in general to industry, he writes: "It can be seen how the
 history of *industry* and the *objective* existence 
of industry as it has developed is the *open* book of the essential powers of 
man, man's psychology present in tangible form."[@marx_early_2005 354] The
"essential powers" of the human develop in complex interrelation with the 
evolving psychology of the human and our essential nature. This degree of 
correspondence makes it possible to define the state of the human at a given
moment by the nature of its production and social organization. 

A mutable human essence that transmutes in tandem with the state of production,
society, and technology is the key to understanding what is perhaps the most
astounding passage in the 1844 manuscripts: "[A]s everything natural must *come
into being*, so man also has his process of origin in *history*. But for him
history is a conscious process, and hence one which constantly supersedes
itself. History is the true natural history of man."[@marx_early_2005 391] If
history has replaced natural history as the determining factor of human
species-being, then what it means to be human is not the same at different
moments in history. Humanness is only *essentially* defined by the constant
transformation of the collective through transformation of external
objects---and thus environment. 

The same would have to be said of different forms of social and technological
organization geographically, as well as temporally. Different societies do not
have identical systems of production, at the same moment or ever, making
species-being alterable according to place and status. This, however,
complicates matters considerably, for it risks creating a hierarchy of
humanness according to degrees of technological sophistication, almost
a technocratic designation of ontological value. This is a particular risk in
the context of Marx's Hegelian conception of historical progress, predicated as
it is on the "supercession" of one era by another, a process that is itself
largely technological in its definition of progress. 

While caution in this direction should be preserved, it is possible to 
mobilize species-being as a way to understand difference, individually and
culturally, rather than as a way to evaluate such difference as the degree of 
"progress". Nick Dyer-Witheford, a particularly systematic commentator on
Marxian species-being, reads it as anything but homogenizing in its
understanding of difference: 

> Marx's account of species-being is not a paean to an organic, functionalist
super-being. Beings are not Borgs. Species-being is actualised to the degree
that individuals not only contribute to the growth in social powers, but also
access these powers as an increase in their own autonomy---indeed, as the very
grounds for their intensifying individuation. Species-being is neither
individual nor supra-individual: it is 'transindividual', both the ground and
compound of a multiplicity of 'particular' species
beings.[@dyer-witheford_1844/2004/2044:_2004 7]

Species-being is not a one-size-fits-all essentialist descriptor, but
a commonality to which there are innumerable possible relationships and
positions. Just as Ian Baucom saw species as collectivity that had the
potential to increase the degree of freedom, rather than curtailing it by
proscribing difference, so does this reading of species-being see it as the
basis of "intensifying individuation" that is simultaneous with an
understanding of the self as part of a larger human whole. It is possible to
have the same species but particular species-beings, responsive to historically
contingnent circumstance, and responsive in different ways. The species thus
becomes a mutable and heterogeneous collectivity.

For London and Marx alike, to summarize, the human collective and 
the "life activity" that supports it are consciously grasped as both the subject and
object of transformation. Marxian species-being is the human's ability to look into
the fire and see a larger self reflected back. In "To Build a Fire", 
London's incurious "man" is unable to survive because he has lost touch with
this fundamental species-being, his larger sustaining humanness. Where the
wolf's fur protects it automatically and the murmurs from the "crypt" of its
instinctual knowledge reservoir determine its behavior, humans can be
preserved beyond our proper environment because of the same behaviors that
drive technological development and industrialization---and, indeed,
environmental destruction, as will become clear in the later agricultural 
novels. Species-being as a concept shows that London's use of the
species-concept as a collectivizing principle is anti-essentialist precisely 
because it is historically situated.

As I will argue in my final section, London came to share a more problematic
version of this pluralistic conception of the human species that can be
developed from Marxian species- being---indeed, his engagement with the species
concept led him to seek such a pluralism. But it was an unstable position for
him, and its development was complicated by his often troubling and usually
contradictory views on race.

### Interlude: *The Acorn-Planter*'s Speculative Species-Being

> Yet the productive life is the life of the
species. It is life-engendering life. The whole
character of a species, its species-character,
is contained in the character of its life activity;
and free, conscious activity is man’s species-character.
Life itself appears only as a means to life.

> Karl Marx, *The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844*

> "The soil & the world belong to those who make the soil & the world most
fruitful & thereby make possible life more _abundant_. [...] the duty of life
[...] is to make life more abundant."

> Jack London, Notes for *The Acorn Planter*

<!--"produce one-sidedly 
while man produces universally;…they produce only themselves, while man 
reproduces the whole of nature."[@marx_early_2005 329] 

[N]ature appears as *his* work and his reality. The object of labour is therefore the
*objectification of the species-life of man*: for man reproduces himself not
only intellectually, in his consciousness, but actively and actually, and he
can therefore contemplate himself in a world he himself has created.
[@marx_early_2005 329]-->

London's understanding of difference---different species-beings within the same
human species---comes to its sharpest point in his attempts to imagine the
futurity of human species-being. In turning the focus of his species-thinking
towards the future rather than the past, he moves beyond the strictly
technological, or artificial, prosthetic humanity to adopt a perspective that
is more concerned with the human's influence on the natural world. London's
speculative species-being is still reminiscent of Marxian species-being in many
of its basic characteristic. But where the historical version resembles the
Marx who says "industry...is the *open book* of the essential powers of man,"
the speculative version more closely resembles the Marx who says that "man
reproduces the whole of nature" in a form of "life-engendering
life."[@marx_early_2005 329. For a comprehensive account of Marx's
under-appreciated interest in nature and ecology, see @burkett_marx_2014; and
@foster_marxs_2000.] This vision of the human's place in the natural world
contradicts the unidirectional environmental determinism that is often
attributed to the naturalist philosophy. It instead presents a further
development on the more complicated version of determinism seen in "To Build
a Fire" and Marxian species-being, in which the human is both a determining
force and a determined entity.

In his notes for a lecture delivered in Oakland, California, for example, he
states his views on environmental determination of the human clearly:
"Environment determines absolutely," he says, causing all forms of life to do
the "easiest thing" in all cases, despite the human illusion of volition. And
yet it is possible for the actions of individual or collective actions to "have
altered [the] environment" such that it determines what the "easiest thing" is.
He comes to the point of his elaborations: 

>We have individual telic actions; in small groups we even have collective
telic action, but in society as a whole we do not have collective telic action.
Things are helter skelter.

>Wherefore the demand is made, that since as individuals, we all perform telic
actions, let us collectively perform telic actions, and not go on in the blind,
haphazard way we are now going on.

As is clear from the context of the rest of the speech, the "we" here is
nothing less than the human species, conceived as a collective. In order to
have the capacity for univocal volition, a type of activity is required of the
human collective that has not been possible to that point, a type of action
that has all the teleology of individual action but on the scale of the human
collective. Though framed here as a simple matter of choice (hence the
exhortation), by the time of *Before Adam*'s publication London would come to
see the capacity for collective teleological action on a smaller scale as an
important step in the evolutionary development of human species-being, one of
the defining advantages the Fire People have over the less resilient Tree
People: time and again the narrator laments the inability of the Folk to come
to a collective decision and enact it. By calling for further expansion
of the collective capacity for "telic action", then, London is calling for the
next step in the transformation of human species-being as a he understands
it.[@london_jack_1916 JL1251]

But to what end? If this is a vision of teleological collective action, what is
the *telos*? In the context of his speech, it would probably have been in line
with the goals of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society and the rest of the
contemporaneous American socialist movement, as these groups composed the
audience of many of his public speaking engagements.[@raskin_jack_2005 59]
Where Jack London's thinking on species comes into contact with his thinking on
environmental destruction, however---in other words, where he becomes most
explicitly Anthropocenic---is in his vision of a more ecological species-being
for the future, with implicit acknowledgement of its shortcomings up to that
point.

London mostly developed his ecological species-being in the final years of his
life, and so it is no surprise that the most paradigmatic statement appears in
*The Acorn-Planter --- A California Forest Play*, a play written and published
(but never performed) in 1916, the year before his death.[^ln-ap-labor] His
notes towards what he calls the play's "argument" are more explicit than the
final version of the play itself on this point: "The soil & the world belong to
those who make the soil & the world most fruitful & thereby make possible life
more _abundant_"---and again, "the duty of life [...] is to make life more
abundant." In this remarkable note, London defines human species-being
according to an ecological ethic. Making life more "abundant" is both the duty
of all living things and the conditions for staking a claim to the planet, or
indeed, any of the land on it. Though the sense in which he means "belongs to"
is ambiguous, it would not be unreasonable, given his political commitments, to
take it as a literal theory of property, or rather, as a scheme for the
abolition of property in an early eco-anarchist mode. In any case, it is
important to note that the version of species-being he presents here is both
speculative and teleological, established with an eye toward the next step he
hopes humanity will take, while simultaneously acting as a statement defining
humanity.[@london_jack_1916 JL2059]

[^ln-ap-labor]: In the front matter of the play itself, London specifies that
*The Acorn-Planter* was to "Be Sung by Efficient Singers Accompanied by
a Capable Orchestra." Planned to be performed for the Bohemian Club, of which
he and Frank Norris were members, the play's demands apparently exceeded its
context, for the requisite efficient singers and capable orchestra were never
found. See @labor_all_1976.

In the play itself, at least superficially, this next step is both ecological
and premised on alliances across racial, national, and cultural divides. Red
Cloud is the titular "Acorn-Planter," leader of the Nishinam tribe according to
a hereditary line leading from the "first man" and first Acorn-Planter. In the
face of a prophecy telling of the coming "Sun Man" who will destroy the
Nishinam, Red Cloud promotes peace and the propagation of beauty and life in
contrast to the bellicose inclinations of the Nishinam "War Chief". When European
explorers arrive matching the description in the prophecy, Red Cloud and the
Sun Man identify themselves according to parallel archetypes of two traditions
(at least as London imagines them): 

> RED CLOUD: I am the Fire-Bringer. I stole the fire from the ground squirrel
and hid it in the heart of the wood. 

> SUN MAN: Then am I Prometheus, your brother. I stole the fire from heaven and
hid it in the heart of the wood. 

> RED CLOUD: I am the Acorn-Planter. I am the Food-Bringer, the Life-Maker.
I make food for more life, ever more life.

> SUN MAN: Then am I truly your brother. Life-Maker am I, tilling the soil in
the sweat of my brow from the beginning of time, planting all manner of good
seeds for the harvest.[@london_acorn-planter:_1916 45]

The first commonality the two assert is identification with the mastery of
fire---which for London, as we have seen, is a symbol of human species-being,
and thus is tantamount to establishing the human as an identity. Immediately
following this affirmed humanity comes their shared commitment to spreading
more life. This commitment relies, however, on surpassing the bellicose nature
embodied by the War Chief. Once surpassed, a new era of humanity is promised:
"Lo, the New Day Dawns, / The day of brotherhood, / The day when all men
/ Shall be kind to all men, / And all men shall be sowers of
life."[@london_acorn-planter:_1916 81]. London envisions a swords-into-ploughshares
moment that will encompass the entire species and transform the planet into
a densely cultivated tangle of life.

Considered in contrast with the actual history London overwrites with his
simplified version of it, however, this statement's easy assumption of
a unified humanity becomes predictably complicated, for the same reasons many
are reasonably skeptical of the Anthropocene's universalism. In this case, the
context is the colonial conquest of the Americas, and London was entirely
unequipped to handle it as justly as he (thought he) wanted to. He conceived of
the play's plot in terms of "Indian & White", "2 motifs that are [in] apparent
conflict that is reconciled in the end." He repeats in his notes that the two
motifs are "the same in import" and nominally allies the indigenous peoples and
European invaders in service of a common goal of increasing life's abundance,
but in fact he presents a narrative of California's conquest by Europeans that
applies different standards of judgment to acts of violence and life-making
alike.[@london_jack_1916 JL2059] Despite the efforts of Red Cloud and the
leader of the Sun Men (called only the Sun Man) to form a friendship, the War
Chief and his followers kill the explorers with stolen muskets, prompting the
dying Sun Man to prophecy the destruction of the Nishinam by his "brothers":
"Many are our brothers and strong. They will come after us. [...] When you
plant blood you harvest blood." In the second act, which takes place a century
later, the Sun Men return to slaughter the Nishinam and take control of
California, after a prolonged exchange with the living incarnation of Red Cloud
in which he and the Sun Man agree that white settlers will increase the
abundance of life on the land through agriculture better than the Nishinam
would have through acorn planting.[@london_acorn-planter:_1916 72] Stripping
the figures of their individual identities by identifying them with mythic
figures, London stages an allegorical struggle for the land between Europeans
and American Indians in the interactions of these typological figures---as well
as a struggle between their respective horticultural imaginaries. He does so
through a distorting lens that justifies white violence as a response to the
aggression of the Nishinam while making a mockery of the indigenous traditions
of the Americas through ludicrous pastiche. The possibility of a defining human
*telos* that compels increased abundance of life on the planet is revealed
a justifying rationale for colonialism.

This is not the whole story regarding the racial implications of London's
speculative species-being, however, nor even the main one---even if its
existence must give pause to any simplistic praise on environmentalist grounds.
The *Acorn-Planter* is merely one particularly direct articulation of an idea
that he explored in different forms across his late agricultural novels, and
the celebration of white colonial conquest at the play's end is a direct
contradiction of his stance in other, more nuanced works in which he challenges
the ideologies that he and many contemporaneous commentators espoused to
justify such conquest.[^ln-reesman] The racism of *The Acorn-Planter*'s
environmentalist vision raises the same questions that are raised by the
Anthropocene today: how to understand an ecological conception of human
species-being without accepting the racist essentialisms and historical traumas
that such universalism has been used to justify in the past.

[^ln-reesman]: This inconsistency has recently been noted elsewhere:
"In any twenty-first-century usage of the word, London could certainly be
termed a racist, but...not a very good (that is, consistent)
one"[@reesman_jack_2009 34]

<!--[What is most startling about the note is that the two
statements, taken together, seem to disenfranchise much of humanity. Failing
our collective duty, modern humans can hardly be said to make life more
abundant, a fact that goes without saying in the twenty-first century but was
already clear to many like London observing ecological trends in the first
decades of the twentieth. Failing this duty in turn means that humanity would
lose the claim to the natural world we have asserted explicitly since Bacon.
Far from endorsing the inexhaustible claim to nature implied by the
technological humanism of "To Build a Fire", London's speculative species-being
is predicated on the conditionality of that claim.[2059]]-->

### The Valley of the Moon: Agriculture, Immigration, Anthropos 

<!-- somewhere: the point here is not to equate racial identification with
identification along the lines of species. Quite the opposite, it is to show
that the species becomes the scale at which it is necessary to think in order
to mitigate the destruction of human activity, drawing inspiration from
agricultural techniques across different lines of environmental and historical
development rather than sticking to human-nature relationships dictated by
notions of racial essentialism and superiority.

-->

> "Our species-being is as builders of worlds."

> Mackenzie Wark, *Molecular Red: Theory for the Anthropocene*[@wark_molecular_2015 3]

*The Valley of the Moon* provides a counter-model to that of *The
Acorn-Planter*, taking London's own rationale that "the soil & the world
belongs to those who make [them] most fruitful," as the basis for an indictment
of "Anglo-Saxon" Americans and for praise of more recent immigrants. Contrary
to many readings of its racial logics as nativist,<!--do these exist? I thought
so but they are difficult to find--> I submit that *The Valley of the Moon* is
not an uncomplicated vessel for these ideologies, but rather creates the
narrative conditions in which they collapse under their own contradictions. But
it is the specific narrative conditions in which this collapse occurs that are
of interest to an Anthropocenic reading of the novel. The second half of the
novel is devoted to the two protagonists' odyssey in search of not only arable
land on which to farm, but responsible and environmentally sound methods with
which to farm it; this search in turn leads to a critical analysis of American
environmental history that blames aspects of the "Anglo-Saxon" identity for the
destruction of the country's lands. Here, in stark contrast to *The
Acorn-Planter*, a more critical depiction of the conqueror leads the characters
to develop farming methods that increase the "abundance of life"---and they do
so by embracing a collective American wisdom that is premised on cultural
pluralism and the horticultural expertise of immigrant communities. They payoff
is a plausible realization of London's speculative species-being. Through hard
work on the farm and careful attention to the ramifications of their actions,
Billy and Saxon figure out "how to place man in the wilderness, to enable him
to live in nature and partake of its restorative essence without contaminating
the crystal springs from which he drinks."[@labor_jack_1962 155]

In short, *The Valley of the Moon*'s ecologically oriented and progressive
conception of species-being arises out of a critique of a more regressive
universalism, while also asking what an environmentalism on the scale of the
human species would look like in practice. It is true that his characters
espouse nativist and "racialist"[^ln-reesman2] ideas about agriculture and
land-ownership at various points in the novel. But in addition to his clear
attempts to challenge the ideologies of his own characters, he presents
a description of the world he sees in the countrysides of California that can
be read against the grain of the novel's nativist moments to see where the
logic of racial supremacy breaks down, and where attaining a life-promoting
species-being requires the protagonists to go beyond their narrow perspective
of racial nationalism and embrace a more pluralist environmentalism. 

[^ln-reesman2]: Jeanne Campbell Reesman uses this term to distinguish racist
attitudes from more historically specific engagements with the theories of race
that proliferated from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries
[@reesman_jack_2009 34-5]. 

The structure of *The Valley of the Moon* is split neatly by two distinct
settings, and one might even say there is a rift at its center----a "metabolic
rift between town and country," to borrow Marx's phrase. With its first half
preoccupied by union busting in downtown Oakland and its second narrating an
odyssey through the farmlands to the north of the city, the novel formally
mirrors a premise that cuts across literary naturalism: the idea that human
life is fundamentally and even biologically different in urban and rural
environments.

The protagonists, named Billy and (tellingly) Saxon, meet and fall in love in
Oakland, where they are married and begin what is briefly a placid life. But
Billy's work as a teamster is not endurable for long, as increasing wage
pressure and resultant strikes result in the death and turn to prostitution,
respectively, of their two best friends. Billy and Saxon effect a flight from
the city of Oakland when teamster union strikes begin to be put down by zealous
police violence---and because of Billy's surrender to alcohol that is the
partial result. The second half of the novel chronicles their travels in search
of plots of land the government is rumored to provide free to whoever claims
it. They idealize the image of such land, imagining that they will find
something akin to a "valley on the moon," otherworldly and perhaps
unattainable. As they wander through the countryside living out of the packs on
their backs, Billy and Saxon gather horticultural knowledge from a combination
of farming operations owned and managed by immigrant communities, market
gardeners with upscale clientele, and a set of books and pamphlets that
represent a cross-section of London's own Beauty Ranch horticultural
library.[^ln-tichi] At last, they find a valley like the one they have dreamed
of, leasing an exhausted farm with the aim of revitalizing it and eventually
buying it outright. The pair put their collected horticultural wisdom into
practice as they settle into a hard-working but unalienated routine of
agricultural labor and living, having escaped the degrading influence of
urbanity once and for all. The novel concludes with an image of
renewed vitality and propagation of life. Where the trauma of death and
poverty in the city caused Saxon to miscarry their first child, in the final
scene she turns to Billy, as they look over a hidden canyon deep in their
valley, to announce that she is pregnant again and has sent back to Oakland for
the baby clothes her brother has kept for her in a chest they associate with
their pioneer ancestors. This line having been drawn between their changed
fortunes, their reproductive capacity, and their family history, London
concludes with a final image connecting them with the vitality of the natural
world: "together they gazed far up the side of the knoll where a doe and
a spotted fawn looked down upon them from a tiny open space between the
trees."[@london_valley_1999 425]

[^ln-tichi]: For a fuller accounting of London's horticultural influences, see
chapter two of this work and @tichi_jack_2015. 

While the novel adheres to the naturalist motif of environmental determinism
and the plot of decline in some senses---Billy's descent into alcoholism and
gambling as a result of his urban environs is an almost wearyingly regular
episode in the naturalist canon---it complicates that logic by reversing it,
allowing for Billy's rehabilitation through a "return" to the land (though he
personally has never known it). This return is nothing less than a purposive
selection of environment as a way of choosing, in turn, the forces that
determine their essential nature, thereby reverting to an earlier moment in the
historical development of species-being. But the species itself is, at
first, too broad a category for the individual consciousness of these
characters to connect with, just as Chakrabarty suggests in *The Climate of
History*. Their affective historical consciousness is limited by the bounds of
their direct progenitors:

> And often [Saxon] found herself dreaming of the arcadian days of her people,
when they had not lived in cities nor been vexed with labor unions and
employers' associations. She would remember the old people's tales
of self-sufficingness, when they shot or raised their own meat, grew their own
vegetables, were their own blacksmiths and carpenters, made their own
shoes---yes, and spun the cloth of the clothes they wore. And something of the
wistfulness in [her brother]'s face she could see as she recollected it when he
talked of his dream of taking up government land.[@london_valley_1999 143]

The fantasy they engage in is uchronistic, a desire to go back to
a pre-alienated state of production and *keep* it un-alienated, creating an
alternate present and revising their horizon of possible futures. What attracts
Saxon is the self-sufficiency that results from laborers owning the means of
production; yearning for escape from "labor unions and employers' associations"
is the same wish that motivated London's revolutionary socialism. In other
words, though it is framed as a movement backwards in time, this is no Luddite
fantasy nor an intentionally regressive one, for it is coupled later with
a scientific and experimental approach to both horticulture and economics. The
fantasy, if it is one, is the possibility of choosing a way of relating to
one's environment according to an historical precedent and somehow reconciling
that way of life with a modern context. Just as London must imagine
a mythological past in *The Acorn-Planter* to develop his speculative vision of
a future human species-being, Saxon can only conceive of a change to her own
being-in-the-world through the lens of her ancestors' lives.

At least at the beginning of the novel, however, this identification with
immediate forebears is only a proxy for their identification with an imagined
"Anglo-Saxon" racial identity. As they set off in search of land, Saxon
elaborates a fantasy of a seafaring past through which she understands their
impending nomadic existence. While Billy is out of the house, she begins
packing family artifacts to be stored by her brother, lingering on one in
particular: 

> She unpacked the scrapbook in order to gaze a last time at the wood
engravings of the Vikings, sword in hand, leaping upon the English sands. Again
she identified Billy as one of the Vikings, and pondered for a space on the
strange wanderings of the seed from which she sprang. Always had her race been
land-hungry, and she took delight in believing she had bred true; for had not
she, despite her life passed in a city, found this same land-hunger in her? And
was she not going forth to satisfy that hunger, just as her people of old time
had done, as her father and mother before her?[@london_valley_1999 239]

She delights in identifying their hunt for land with an imagined racial
identity predicated on conquest, conquest of the type London attempts to
justify in *The Acorn-Planter*. Furthermore, Saxon's perspective in this moment
is defined by racial essentialism and genetic determinism, imagining individual
characteristics as arising out of a racial "seed" and embracing an ideal of
someone who has "bred true" according to that seed. 

Rants like this one, common in the first half of the novel and voiced by Billy
and Saxon alike, have understandably motivated criticism of the novel's
nativism. Christopher Gair rightly notes that in depicting Billy and Saxon's
attempts to "retrace the steps both of their parents and of their Anglo-Saxon
prognitors," the novel exposes "an anxiety about race 'purity' and the decline
of the 'original' settlers in California."[@gair_way_1993 419] Gair goes on to
claim that in finding their ideal environment in the Sonoma Valley, they find
self-realization---but that it is a self-realization obtained by asserting
distinctions between themselves ("real" Americans) and the immigrants who own
much of the land around Oakland, whose farms they pass through on their search.
[@gair_way_1993 427] Building on the work of Walter Benn Michaels, Gair
interprets their journey as a necessary step in their racial
self-identification, exercising "a 'right' granted [them] by birth but
requiring at the same time that [they] lay claim to it."[Qtd. in
@gair_citizenship_1993 426] Gair's analysis effectively captures the
motivations Billy and Saxon voice as they set out from Oakland, as well as the
common nativist tropes they embody.

But there is good reason to question any reading of *The Valley of the Moon*
that takes the nativist sentiments of the novel's first half as defining the
perspective of the whole, treating Billy and Saxon's ideology as either stable
throughout the novel or as expressions of an uncomplicated perspective on
London's part. Understood in the scope of the entire novel, these sentiments of
nativism and celebrations of Anglo-Saxon conquest actually become objects of,
if not critique, then structural instability and considerable doubt. Even in
Saxon's fantasy, the uncomplicated celebration of ancestry, and the fixed
essence that implies, is set up to be undercut. She does not assert these
opinions with full narrative backing so much as posit them while London maintains
a degree of distance, less overt than his criticisms of "the man" in "To Build
a Fire" but with a similar effect. Saxon's ideas about her "Viking" ancestry
are framed as dubious questions or distant mythic fantasies rather than stable
facts. 

One need not rely on the subtle uncertainty London casts on this passage for
clarity, however, for a critique of Anglo-Saxonism erupts more explicitly near
the novel's end at the hands of Jack Hastings, a figure who also gives Billy
and Saxon some of the knowledge they need to succeed as farmers (thereby
establishing him as a reliable figure). Hastings pierces the misty fantasy of
a benevolent Anglo-Saxon conqueror quite definitely. He is prompted directly by
"Saxon...speaking of the land-hungry Anglo-Saxons", presumably in terms like
those of the fantasy above, and his patience with her racial fantasy is short: 

> "Land-hogs," he snapped. "That's our record in this country. As one old
Reuben told a professor of an agricultural experiment station: 'They ain't no
sense in tryin' to teach me farmin'. I know all about it. Ain't I worked out
three farms?' It was his kind that destroyed New England. Back there great
sections are relapsing to wilderness. [...] And the same thing is going on, in
one way or another, the same land-robbing and hogging, over the rest of the
country.... [@london_valley_1999 348]

Though Hastings spreads the blame to include other groups later in the passage,
it is clear from context that when he condemns "our record in this country," he
means "our" in reference to Saxon's ideas about the benevolent land-hunger of
Anglo-Americans. Her eager appropriation of this identity and the response to
land it implies is almost mocked by proximity to the man who thinks exhausting
soil is a good working definition of successful farming. What Saxon earlier
took as a welcome part of an inherited identity is presented back to her as
a cause of widespread environmental destruction.

Overcoming this rapacious wastefulness requires them to overcome none other
than their sense of racial superiority. As they travel through the country
north of Oakland on their way to the Sonoma Valley, their many agricultural
epiphanies are occasioned by encounters with immigrants, particularly the
Portuguese. Speaking to a local "linesman" laying telephone wire for a farm
owned by Portuguese immigrants, they are told that the price of land
immediately outside the city is so high because its productivity and vitality
have been increased by the labors of primarily Portuguese farmers, who merely
by "bein' wise to farmin'" are able to "get more out of twenty acres than
[native-born Americans] could out of a hundred an' sixty." The problem is the
approach to agriculture and a general lack of horticultural knowledge, the same
lack that would soon cause the dust bowl, derived from the same ignorance that
caused the British countryside to be disastrously overgrazed. Or, as one
interlocutor puts it: "we ain't got the *sabe*."[@london_valley_1999 247-9] 

The abrupt shift to Portuguese with the word "*sabe*" is telling, in that it
encapsulates a common trend among California farmers of the moment to link
racial and national identity causally with horticultural acumen. London kept
a file with the manuscripts of *The Valley of the Moon*, currently housed at
the Jack London Collection at the Huntington Library in California, containing
pages of source material from which he drew liberal inspiration for the novel's
insights on farming and the state of rural California. More of this material
will be discussed in the next chapter, but on the connection between
horticulture and nationality, several pieces stand out. Two pieces in
a *Saturday Evening Post* series entitled "Lessons From Our Alien Farmers" were
particularly fruitful for London's composition of the novel. Written by Forrest
Crissey, a regular contributor to the *Post* who would go on to write a book
called *The Story of Foods* on similar issues, two articles from October 7 and
November 18, 1911 discuss the role of Dalmatian and Portuguese farmers in
transforming the burnt-out plots of rural California into thriving farmland.
London would paraphrase passages of Crissey's reports and draw on details of
these farmers' ingenuity in *The Valley of the Moon*. In the November article
on the Portuguese, for example, Crissey describes a brace made out of living
wood grafted into the crotch of apple-tree branches, which grow with the tree
and help the branches withstand the weight of a heavy harvest. London had
a habit of making notes for scenes or writing snippets of dialogue directly in
the margins of his source material, and in this section of Crissey's article,
he wrote Billy's response to the live-wood brace: "Billy remarks: 'What
a growth! A curiosity!'" The linesman who mourns Anglo-Americans lack of "sabe"
likewise appears in the margins of that page, along with notes toward his
speech.[@london_jack_1916 JL1369]

London's tendency to discuss agricultural principles as racial traits also
appears to derive from his reading of Crissey's articles, both Crissey's own
commentary and that of the farmers he quotes. On the apple orchards where the
living braces were found, one farmer remarks, "That's the nature of the race.
They're sharp---and nobody has to show them a clever thing in the line of
better farming methods a second time. [...] When one Portuguese has found
a better method of doing something worth while, you may depend upon it that the
others of his blood will have it in short order and that it will run through
the whole settlement."<!--[ November 18, 10]--> In the earlier article on Dalmatian
farmers, in a section entitled "Hereditary Apple Experts," Crissey opines that
"Insight into fruit-handling is almost a fixed racial trait. It belongs to
their race as definitely as do their dark eyes and swarthy skin."<!--[October 10,
20]--> These statements, and the innumerable others like them throughout London's
files, go beyond recognition that farmers from different countries will have
learned different agricultural traditions, some more effective than others in
the California climate---though this more reasonable perspective is also well
represented in the file. Rather, they suggest that success in agriculture
is "fixed" and inborn, *literally* hereditary rather than learned. And although
the tone and content of these articles is largely admiring and takes spreading
agricultural techniques as its explicit aim, racialization of these traits
takes on a more sinister sheen in the light of Anglo-American farmers who feel
that they are unable to compete with "aliens" who they believe are buying up
all the productive land. 

That London adopted this racialized view of agricultural competition is
undeniable. *The Valley of the Moon*'s nativism shows through in Billy and
Saxon's response, and the responses of other Anglo-American characters they
encounter on the road, to the state of affairs they see in the farmland they
pass through on the way to Sonoma. Calling the Pajaro Valley "New Dalmatia,"
one minor character named Benson says, "We're being squeezed out. We Yankees
thought we were smart. Well, the Dalmatians came along and showed they were
smarter. [...] It won't be long before they own the whole valley, and the last
American will be gone."[@london_valley_1999 292] Insistently equating
Americanness with Anglo-Saxonism, he interprets as a threat the agricultural
acumen of immigrants understood as not-white. Again and again, the novel
articulates a panic at the prospect of a non-white America, and environmentally
conscious agriculture is the surprising source of the racial sea-change.

Yet the novel does not allow for a simple condemnation of these agricultural
methods and their immigrant practitioners, nor could it function narratively
without the very pluralism by which its characters are threatened. At the same
time that Benson laments the defeat of the "Yankees", he gives voice to
a grudging respect for the horticultural methods by which they were bested. In
discussing a valley largely owned and worked by Japanese immigrants, he
continues: "But that's another point where we Americans lose out. There isn't
anything wasted in this valley, not a core nor a paring; and it isn't the
Americans who do the saving." Billy tries to defend the record of
Anglo-American settlers by saying "It was our folks that made this
country[....] Fought for it, opened it up, did everything---", Benson
interrupts: "But develop it[....] We did our best to destroy it, as we
destroyed the soil of New England."[@london_valley_1999 294-5] A nativist
perspective is indeed voiced in the discussion of ecological agricultural
practices, and repeatedly so, but they are just as repeatedly undercut by
a condemnation of the Anglo-American environmental record, which immigrants are
undoing through agriculture that builds the vitality of the soil. By the logic
of London's notes toward *The Acorn-Planter*, the immigrants rightfully come to
own the soil of their new home by making it more abundant.

Just as America's land needs immigrants to rescue it from exhaustion at the
hands of "Yankees," so does the novel rely on immigrants to complete Billy and
Saxon's narrative journey, albeit without (as usual) giving them the credit
they deserve. The arc of their development as characters is defined by a flight
from the city, which has a degrading and dehumanizing influence, to discover an
unprecedented freedom and prosperity in ranching. But this freedom and
prosperity do not come from Saxon getting in touch with an imagined
"Anglo-Saxon" identity.  Indeed, we are made to understand that being guided by
her conception of that identity would lead to a destruction of the land they
hope will save them, merely a new kind of poverty, and probably dispossession
by more knowledgeable farmers. 

Nor, of course, does such an identity exist in the mythic way she imagines it.
London appears to have known as much, for Saxon's conception of what it means
to be an "Anglo-Saxon", exercising an inner Viking whose seafaring gives way
naturally (somehow) to agriculture, appears ironically to have been derived
from Crissey's article on not Anglo-Saxons, but the very Portuguese against
whom her Anglo-Saxonism is supposedly defined. Discussing this "seafaring
people" without whom in "the old days of plunder and adventure on the high sees
no pirate crew was quite complete," Crissey draws a sketch of the Portuguese
that London uses for Saxon's defining vision of her Anglo-Saxon origins.
Crissey describes how their "sea legs have been trained into steady plow legs"
as a paradox resolved by a "land hunger" that is their "ruling
passion."<!--[November 18, 9]--> London recasts this land-hunger as an Anglo-Saxon
trait, but by the time it comes to describe Anglo-Saxonism, it has been
stripped of the agricultural wisdom he and Crissey associated with the
Portuguese and attached to a uniquely Anglo-American destructiveness. London
has, consciously or not, established Saxon's Anglo-American ideal not *against*
their immigrant neighbors, but using the very same terms.[@london_jack_1916
JL1369]

The narrative and its speculative vision of human species-being cannot be
fulfilled by identification with a racial identity, at least not with the
Anglo-Saxon racial identity Billy and Saxon claim. The only way they can attain
what London sees as the duty of human life, which is to increase the abundance
of other life on the planet, is through a pluralist American landscape from
which they can learn responsible stewardship, a landscape which comes to
represent a multi-racial globe in miniature as Billy and Saxon's interlocutors
repeatedly point out farms that one could supposedly mistake for Japan or
Dalmatia. In such a landscape, Billy and Saxon are able to read "currants
between the tree rows, beans between the currant rows, a row of beans close on
each side of the trees, an' rows of beans along the ends of the tree rows"---an
auspicious pattern, given the prevalence of nitrogen-fixing beans that will
preserve the vitality of the soil season after season.[@london_valley_1999 250.
This passage is a close paraphrase of a passage from Crissey's November 1911
article on the Portuguese: "One of these town orchards in San Leandro has
currants between the orchard rows, beans between the currant rows, a row of
beans close on each side of the trees, beans between the trees in the row and
beans from the ends of the rows to the wheeltrack in the street." (Jack London
Collection, JL1369.)] Terrace-farming transforms groups who are denigrated
elsewhere in the novel into keepers of horticultural magic, making productive
farms out of nothing: in "Greece, in Ireland, in Dalmatia [...] they went
around and gathered every bit of soil they could find [...] and carried it up
the mountains on their backs and built farms---*built* them, *made* them, on
the naked rock."[@london_valley_1999 294] Without learning from immigrant
farmers, complicating and undercutting if not renouncing their nativism in the
process, Billy and Saxon would have gone the way of Steinbeck's "Okies" just as
the fertile valleys of California would have gone the way of Oklahoma. 

Though a simple exchange of horticultural knowledge, these moments can be read
as emblems of cultural exchange---maintaining the original resonances of
"culture" as cultivation of life in the land. Subtly, or (perhaps more
probably) by accident, *The Valley of the Moon* makes a case for an
environmental future predicated on global difference. It shows that in an
earlier instantiation of the challenge posed by the unifying "*anthropos*" of
"Anthropocene," the freedom of difference was indeed threatened by the
universalizing gesture. It also suggests that this threat was not
insurmountable, but required a just accounting of environmental history and
resistance to racial nationalism.

---

There is much more to be said about the perspective on sustainable horticulture
presented in *The Valley of the Moon*, and more *will* be said shortly. In order to understand the full context of London's
agricultural turn, it has to be placed in the context of other naturalist farm
novels---and those novels, in turn, must be placed in the context of another
naturalist sub-genre, the novel of finance. In the next chapter, I will place
*The Valley of the Moon* and *Burning Daylight* alongside novels by Frank
Norris and Ellen Glasgow to ask: Is the naturalist Anthropocene really
a Capitalocene?
