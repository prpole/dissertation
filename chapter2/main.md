> For my fear is the fear of long ago, the fear that was rampant in the Younger
World, and in the youth of the Younger World. In short, the fear that reigned
supreme in that period known as the Mid-Pleistocene. (1)

Jack London's *Before Adam* (year) begins with an act of geological
periodization. But the object of this periodization is not a stratigraphic
record, the layers of mineral sedimentation that make up the inorganic archive
of the planet. The archive here is the periodizing consciousness itself, having
gained access to the accreted layers of memory that make up its identity---an
identity that in turn encompasses far more than a sum of individual
experiences. 

... [novel summary]

Jack London's geology, in short, is a geology of the human, a geology in which
the human is both the subject and object of study. A century later, we have
a name for this geology: the Anthropocene. <!--room for mini arg-statmeent
here?--> [explores the intersection of geology (?), the species, and the
individual consciousness in London]

Of course, though technically only designating a geological epoch defined by
the influence of collective human activity, the term "Anthropocene" has always
indicated much more than a geological consideration of the human. Even in some
of the earliest uses of the term, it had already come to indicate anthropogenic
destruction of the planet through means as diverse as carbon emissions,
deforestation, population growth, and animal domestication
[@crutzen_geology_2002, @crutzen_"anthropocene"_2006]. Considering the "human
species" as a universalizing concept is both an explanation of this destruction
and a response to it. According to Dipesh Chakrabarty, in his seminal essay
"The Climate of History: Four Theses," "Species may indeed be the name of
a placeholder for an emergent, new universal history of humans that flashes up
in the moment of the danger that is climate change" [-@chakrabarty_climate_2009
221]. If our "moment of danger" is causing us to reach for the "species"
concept, causing us to seek a biological collective that exceeds and comprises
the individual, it is in response to a dual relationship to mass extinction. We
recognize on one hand that the human collective has become a destructive force
by its very nature, exceeding the capacities usually known to biology. But we
recognize at the same time that this destructiveness does not come with
omnipotence. To think of the human in a superhuman timescale is to take
seriously the threat of self-inflicted mass extinction, to place ourselves in
the long history of lifeforms coming into being and disappearing in
a geological moment.

And yet, though the species is a universal concept that "flashes up" in an
existentially threatening moment, it inhabits a timescale too far removed from
that of human experience to be easily apprehensible---or, for that matter,
apprehensible at all. As Chakrabarty has it: 

> Who is the we? We humans never experience ourselves as a species. We can only
intellectually comprehend or infer the existence of the human species but never
experience it as such. There could be no phenomenology of us as a species. Even
if we were to emotionally identify with a word like mankind, we would not know
what being a species is, for, in species history, humans are only an instance
of the concept species as indeed would be any other life form. But one never
experiences being a concept. (220)

We may be able to conceive of the totality, and we may be able to experience it
as a kind of guilt. But the phenomenological gap between the self and the
species is too large: species may always be already embodied, but it is never
experienced as such. The Anthropocene then presents a moment of distinct crisis
in the individual imagination. Thinking our new epoch requires that the
individual experience be expanded even further beyond the self than what normal
historical consciousness requires, a collectivity that is less an
identification with something larger than an interrogation of an embodied
identity, a recognition of the collective that is stitched into the fabric of
each individual. 

Herein, of course, lies the great danger of species-thinking as a theoretical
program. It risks ignoring a half-century of critical theory, the very basis of
which is opposition to the kind of essentialism a discourse of the human
species would seem to imply. Ian Baucom, considering Chakrabarty's universal
species concept, points out that "it seems to wreak havoc on the key principles
of historical understanding and political commitment that have animated not
only Chakrabarty’s preceding body of work, but the broader project of
postcolonial critique to which that work has been dedicated"
[-@baucom_human_2012 3]. To consider the species concept as a universal of the
same type as those that postcolonial critique has opposed in the past, however,
would be to miss Chakrabarty's point. It is not a universalism in the Hegelian
mode, which Chakrabarty himself has opposed in the name of a struggle for the
"freedom of difference," but a "natural--scientific" universalism that presents
a new paradigm entirely[@-baucom_human_2012 3]. As Baucom reads it, in this new
paradigm "freedom can no longer be conceived of as the freedom of difference
against the power of the globalizing same." Rather, because "freedom" now
relies on survival through a collective effort to save the planet by
transforming our relationship to it, this universal concept has become a *sine
qua non* of freedom itself. The pursuit of freedom is now "a task of the
species, as species, for the species. It is a universal human challenge,
a challenge of humanity’s shared natural history and its shared planetary
future" [-@baucom_human_2012 3]. 

The problem of species, of the "*anthropos*" in the Anthropocene, is thus
manifold and entangled. It demands a natural-scientific universalism that takes
the species concept as the basis for human history and as the starting point in
the struggle for freedom. It requires an understanding of anthropogenic
planetary change based on this species history. But in developing such
a species history, we risk backsliding into the essentialisms of the past, and
thus a concerted effort must be made to differentiate a natural-scientific
universalism of collective survival from the universals of the past that have
long been used to justify programs of domination and supremacy. 

And yet over all these tasks hovers an enduring paradox: to address the
conceptual and practical challenges of the Anthropocene, we must embrace
a concept that Chakrabarty claims fundamentally exceeds the capacities of human
experience, that has no phenomenology, that is somehow both embodied and
inaccessible.

Though differently framed, the defining questions and formal characteristics of
literary naturalism speak directly to this set of concerns. Pursuing the
well-trodden ground of the "determinism" question in literary naturalism,
critics of the genre have debated the role of species characteristics in
determining the actions and experiences of the
individual.[^ln-determinism-species-examples] The naturalist character is,
famously or notoriously, less notable as an individual subjectivity than as
a nexus of warring deterministic forces. The most marked conflicts occur
between "forces" defined by evolutionary conditioning and those that are
a product of a physical and social environment, especially in the context of
urban environments.[ Norris examples? ] Introducing the species concept into
this discourse merely requires a reminder that speciation is the product of
evolutionary variation.

[^ln-determinism-species-examples]: some examples of naturalist criticism that
drives this home? Look at the classics: Pizer, Walcutt... "Determined Fictions"

But when this common reading of the naturalist character is recast not just in
terms of the species concept, but in terms of the species concept with all the
resonances it has gained in the discourse of the Anthropocene, readings of the
naturalist form and its philosophical underpinnings alike gain added
significance. In treating characters as more than individual subjectivities, as
typological figures and as products of biological and environmental conditions,
the narrative strategies unique to naturalist fiction pursue the same
imaginative capacities that are required to conceive of the species as
a category of experience as well as an abstract scientific concept<!--too
convoluted, rewrite-->. It is through fear, a visceral and decidedly
unscientific experience, that the *Before Adam* protagonist accesses the
history of the species. The result is not a conception but a duality of being
that encompasses a multi-epochal humanness. 


[naturalism is the staging ground, because in taking the individual as the
nexus of determinism, that's exactly what they were trying to access]



This chapter will explore the ways in which literary naturalism, and
particularly the works of Jack London, has already taken up one of the chief
heuristic challenges posed by the Anthropocene as a theoretical discourse: to
consider the place of natural history in human history by conceiving of the
human *as a species*.
