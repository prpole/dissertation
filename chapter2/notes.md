# stabs at a human expression of human species-being

In the Marxian framework to which London subscribed, capitalism engenders a
constant and conscious revolutionization of the means of production, as a
consequence of which "all that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is
profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real
conditions of life, and his relations with his kind."[@marx_communist_... ?]
Under these conditions of constant change, the "real conditions of life" become both a revelation and a
teleologically mutable object, something realized individually and collectively
*through its transformation*. Species-being refers to humanity's
conscious transformation of itself in this larger context of
revolutionization, a transformation of the collective's defining nature that is 
inextricable from that of the means of production. Nature, objects, and systems
of production are simply the "inorganic body" of the human that makes this
transformative knowledge of the collective self possible.

# The Human Drift

OMG

Defines the human according to death, which is crazy, but then:

"All his days, down all the past, have ben spent in killing. And from the
fear-stricken, jungle-lurking, cave-haunting creature of long ago, he won to
empery over the whole animal world, because he developed into the most terrible
and awful killer of all the animals. He found himself crowded. He killed to
make room, and as he made room ever he increased and found himself crowded, and
ever he wnet on killing to make more room. Like a settler clearing land of its
weeds and forest bushes in order to plant corn, so man was compelled to clear
all manner of life away in order to plant himself. And, sword in hand, he has
literally hewn his way through the vast masses of life that occupied the earth
space he coveted for himself. And ever he has carried the battle wider and
wider, until to-day not only is he a far more capable killer of men and animals
than ever before, but he has pressed the battle home to the infinite and
invisible hosts of menacing lives in the world of micro-organisms." 

And: "We know [our ancient forebears] for what they were, and before the monkey
cage of any menagerie we catch truer glimpses and hints and resemblances of
what our ancestors really were long and long ago. And by killing, incessant
killing, by making a shambles of the planet, those apelike creatures have
developed even into you and me."

The killing of men is an extension of the killing of other things: "Nations
that faltered, that waxed prosperous in fat valleys and rich river deltas, were
swept away by the drifts of stronger men who were nourished on the hardships of
deserts and mountians and who were more capable with the sword." <-- an
EXPLICITLY environmentally determined human history 

Asserts that population will eventually catch up with us, reads industry purely
as a vehicle of that increase rather than part of the destruction; except that
increase is always by destruction in this schema

On China: "There is another reputed bogie---the Yellow Peril; yet the men of
China are only men, like any other race of men, and all men, down all history,
have drifted hungrily, here, there and everywhere over the planet, seeking for
something to eat. What other men do, may not the Chinese do?"

Equates racial superiority and domination with peace: "The more recent drifts
of the stronger races, carving their way through the lesser breeds to more
earth-space, have led to peace, ever to wider and more lasting peace. The
lesser breeds, under penalty of being killed, have been compelled to lay down
their weapons and cease killing among themselves....The planet is being
subdued. The wild and hurtful are either tamed or eliminated. From the beasts
of prey and the cannibal humans down to the death-dealing microbes, no quarter
is given; and daily, wider and wider areas of hostile territory, whether of a
warring desert-tribe in Africa or a pestilential fever-hole like Panama, are
made peacable and habitable for mankind." Well for fuck's sake.

"Man, the latest of the ephemera, is pitifully a creature of temperature,
strutting his brief day on the thermometer. Behind him is a past wherein it was
too warm to exist. Ahead of him is a future wherein it will be too cold for him
to exist. He cannot adjust himself to that future, because he cannot alter
universal law, because he cannot alter his own construction or the molecules
that compose him." 

"And for us who live, no worse can happen than has happened to the earlier
drifts of man, marked to-day by ruined cities of foreign civilizations---ruined
cities, which, on excavation, are found to rest on ruins of earlier cities,
city upon city, and further cities, down to a stratum where, still earlier,
wandering herdsmen drove their flocks, and where, even preceding them, wild
hunters chased their prey long after cave-man and the man of the
squatting-place cracked the knuckle-bones of wild animals and vanished from the
earth. There is nothing terrible about it. With Richard Hovey, when he faced
death, we can say: 'Behold! I have lived!' And with another and greater one, we
can lay ourselves down with a will. The one drop of living, the one taste of
being, has been good; and perhaps our greatest achievement will be that we
dreamed immortality, even though we failed to realize it."



# Reading notes

## SB and Anthropocene

### Johnson

Johnson critiques the techonological futurity of a human-machine version of
species-being and the version of history it implies, saying that it encourages
us to take the world "in hand" and manage rather than searching for new modes
of organization in concert with nonhuman lifeforms. Her interest is in
biosensing and biomimicry technologies as natural extensions of a fundamental
aspect of humanity's species-being, "reproducing the whole of nature" (Marx).
In her schema it is through technology, but particularly assemblages of
technological and non-human lifeforms, that humanity is able to sense the
Anthropocene. 

Quotes:

- 'Marx maintained that living labor endowed humans with the capacity to
reproduce not only their own life but also “the whole of nature”' (277). 

- 'Marx named the capacity to transform our collective development “species
being.” With “free, conscious activity,” he claimed, humans mold material into
objects of personal and social use. To be human, for Marx, was to remake: to
unsettle and reshape the whole of the world.' (277)

- "We apprehend the world through the tools and prosthetic technologies we use
to modify it" (279). 

- "Like technology, nonhuman life shapes human apprehension of nonliving
materials---and ourselves. Indeed, nonhumans have always been a part of our
technological apparatuses" (282). 

- "Perhaps this was the power of species being all along: that it drew together
a critique of the mode of production with concerns about reproduction" (289).

### Dyer-Witheford 2004a, Return

"a species-being whose nature is to change its nature, and whose
only essence is the capacity for transformation." (6) Yes

Note Spivak: points out that all the basic biological needs stuff is more often
called "species-living" or "species-life," whereas "species-being" is a more
uniquely human concept that relies on transformation of nature and
self-transformation as a result

"Marx's account of species-being is not a paean to an organic, functionalist
super-being. Beings are not Borgs. Species-being is actualised to the degree
that individuals not only contribute to the growth in social powers, but also
access these powers as an increase in their own autonomy - indeed, as the very
grounds for their intensifying individuation.'^ Species-being is neither
individual nor supra-individual: it is 'transindividual', both the ground and
compound of a multiplicity of 'particular' species beings.'" (7)

"The more radical reading is, however, to see 'the human' as itself an
historical instantiation of species-being, one bound in contradictory ways to
the birth of capitalism." (8)

From 1844 MSS, qtd in D-W 7: "The real, active orientation of man to himself as
a species being, or his manifestation as a real species being (i.e. as a human
being) is ... only possible through the cooperative action of all mankind - as
the result of history."

This is basically the same article as above... but some good summaries in the
first couple pages.

# Scraps

Before one can take up Chakrabarty's call to adopt
species as the basis of a political collective for environmentalist praxis,
some means of addressing the question ontologically must first be found. For
London's part, he considered species ontologically in his "dog stories" before
developing their full political and ecological implications in his late
agricultural novels. 

## s-b scraps

Finally,
species-being is the ultimate loss in the process of capitalist alienation. The
productive life-activity so essential to the human becomes, in alienated labor,
"*external* to the worker, i.e. does not belong to his essential being"
[@marx_early_2005 326]. Through the loss of this productive essence, the
worker's activity ceases to be "his own spontaneous activity." It instead
"belongs to another, it is a loss of [the worker's] self" [@marx_early_2005
327]. Losing the object of labor means that freedom of action, freedom in any
but the most animal functions, is also lost. Species-being ceases to be
possible when the conscious productive activity, life-producing life, is
disrupted by estrangement of labor, and this is so primarily because of the
loss of freedom that estrangement entails.]

<!-- alternate version of what's at teh end of the tbaf section -->



The lines of comparison London necessarily draws with this strategy speak
directly to some of the most debated topics of studies of literary naturalism
and Anthropocene theory alike. To narrate a dog experiencing its inherent
species-nature, its dogness, is to narrate the phenomenology of determinism
itself, or in other words to try to capture the feeling of responding to
"forces" that dictate behavior below the level of conscious choice.
Furthermore, splitting the hairs that distinguish the sub-species of the
domestic dog from the wolf, *Canis lupus familiaris* from *Canis lupus*, lends
a neat analogue (at least as London uses it) to the naturalist preoccupation
with environmental determinism in the city and the country, respectively. The
dog character is a testing ground for a theory of the human in which our
defining humanity arises out of a deterministic, bestial base. By this
strategy, London also raises questions regarding the universalizing function of
species discourse, which, as has already been seen, is among the first problems
the Anthropocene raises for the humanities. To consider the human and the dog
in the same terms, one must ask if they bear the same relation to species as
a collectivizing principle, and what species even means in an ontological sense
when the object of contemplation is not *Canis lupus* but *Homo sapiens*.
Before one can take up Chakrabarty's call to adopt species as the basis of
a political collective for environmentalist praxis, some means of addressing
the question ontologically must first be found. For London's part, he
considered species ontologically in his "dog stories" before developing their
full political and ecological implications in his late agricultural novels. 

While a dog's perspective is a useful lens for London's thinking on species, he
does not see species as an identical concept when applied to humans and
non-humans, nor as an identical phenomenal experience. The distinction he draws
between species as a human and non-human concept can be closely described by
the Marxian concept of species-being, a term whose very composition seems to
undercut Chakrabarty's contention that the species is not able to be
experienced except intellectually. Developed in *The Economic and Philosophical
Manuscripts of 1844* and largely abandoned thereafter, species-being refers to the
human's simultaneous transformation of the self and environment through
conscious production on a scale that exceeds the individual. All animals
produce; animals, however, 

> produce one-sidedly while man produces universally;…they produce only
themselves, while man reproduces the whole of nature…. [N]ature appears as
*his* work and his reality. The object of labour is therefore the
*objectification of the species-life of man*: for man reproduces himself not
only intellectually, in his consciousness, but actively and actually, and he
can therefore contemplate himself in a world he himself has created.
[@marx_early_2005 329]

In the terms established by species-being, the human collective and the "life
activity" that supports it are consciously grasped as both the subject and
object of transformation. Though species-being exceeds the "species-life" of
animals, by which Marx means the species-defined drives that focus primarily on
the needs of reproduction, species-being is a uniquely human capacity to define
the nature of the individual and the collective by the transformation of
external entities: objects, the environment, and social
relations.[@dyer-witheford_return_2004 4-6, @johnson_limits_2017 277] 





## VM scraps

Finally, these attempts to connect with personal family histories, real or
imagined, coincide with an understanding of the land itself not as it is, but
as a process resulting in its current state. Billy and Saxon (especially Saxon)
see the conventional wisdom of California farmers gone badly awry, represented
most succinctly by a farmer who brags about how many plots of land he has
single-handedly exhausted. They also see in the larger environmental history of
the country this same short-sightedness, an agricultural mode oriented to
building cities by stripping the countrysides with no thought given to
maintaining the soil. In other words, they discover that the same forces that
produced the environment from which they fled have also looted the Arcadia they
hoped to find. Their atavism gives them a counterpoint, a second comparative
perspective with which they can see the destruction wrought by too great
a degree of human influence on our environment. The wider view they gain
ultimately allows them to make a different choice. Rejecting the trend, they
begin systematically building the soil on first one farm, then several in the
Sonoma Valley. The novel concludes with Saxon becoming pregnant, something they
worried would not be possible after their travails in the city led to
a miscarriage. This ending establishes a clear symbolic link (albeit
a troubling one from an ecofeminist perspective) between their integration into
a larger narrative of heredity and species and the discovery of an alternative
to environmental destruction. 

And yet, in *The Valley of the Moon* and much of London's larger body of work,
the topic that stands out most clearly is not species, but race. Indeed, the
two concepts can be difficult to untangle in London's work, a fact that does
nothing to quell concerns that any discourse predicated on the species will
risk being inherently regressive. Billy and Saxon's attempts to understand
themselves in a larger timescale is often framed as a quest for a racially pure
identity. They initially bond over a shared "Anglo-Saxon" lineage and routinely
utter nativist commonplaces. As a result, criticism of *The Valley of the Moon*
has largely, if understandably, missed the environmentalist forest for the
racist trees. 


[note: in VM London reverses the logic of the Acorn-Planter (or vice versa): in his sources and the novel itself, immigrants rightly displace wasteful American farmers because they more intensively cultivate the land.]

[contradicts common view of London as purely deterministic and fully committed
to the "law of tooth and fang" version of his environmental imaginary. This
developed at the end of his life, particularly in VM... Earl Labor 155 on VM]

[what does this look like in a non-speculative setting? VM and agro novels
give us a hint; but as in A-P, the utopian humanism is compromised by
a ham-headed conception of racial supremecy as a defining aspect of the species
conversation. We need to ask: is it possible to envision a pluralistic
universal humanism, guided from within according to partially but not entirely
technological means, without also accepting the view that this battle for
supremecy has to be concluded first? (the supremecy thing is from the
archives... maybe best not to go there for time reasons) VM actually presents
a counter-point, somewhat similar to A-P but with a different approach to race.
It remains appropriative but also shows how the supremecist logic that is given
voice in A-P and the beginning of VM collapses under its own weight.]

[eventually: London is trying to voice a progressive version of species-being but getting in
his own way with an understanding of race that makes species-unity impossible
(but does it? Isn't there room for Saxon's eventual pluralism?)]





[While the story as a whole follows a "back-to-the land" motif that is
built on the naturalist logic of determinism and decline while complicating
that logic at the same time. Conceding a degree of environmental determinism,
at least as far as the broad categories of rural and urban environments, the
pair nevertheless have a degree of choice in choosing a new environment and in
transforming the environment they find themselves in---which transformation is
possible to a much greater degree beyond the dense and alienated environment of
the city.]

[For Billy and Saxon, choosing among possible environments and, by extension,
possible modes of being also entails choosing how to relate to their forebears.
They experience a more voluntary form of the atavism of *Before Adam*: where
*BA*'s protagonist unwittingly exceeds the boundaries of individual experience,
Billy and Saxon seek out a consciousness that exceeds themselves and the
timescale of the individual. They willfully change their environment and their
relation to it only after understanding themselves in terms of their forebears
and of broader historical action. [Conceding a degree of environmental
determinism, at least as far as the broad categories of rural and urban
environments, the pair nevertheless have a degree of choice in choosing a new
environment and in transforming the environment they find themselves in---which
transformation is possible to a much greater degree beyond the dense and
alienated environment of the city.]]



<!--on BD-->

Experiencing humanness *per se*, and doing so on a scale that exceeds the
individual, has ramifications for London's environmental consciousness just as
it does for environmental consciousness in the Anthropocene. Nowhere is this
more evident than in his agricultural novels, written in the final years of his
life as he worked his "Beauty Ranch," an experimental farm in the Sonoma
Valley, California, which became a material staging ground for his budding
ecological consciousness. 

*Burning Daylight* (1910) can be read as narrating the development of such
a consciousness. Just as London's best-known writing begins with stories of dog
running and gold mining in the far north and concluded in agricultural
narratives, Elam "Burning Daylight" Harnish's story begins when he goes from
carrying mail in the Yukon [check task and place] to striking it rich on
fortuitous gold claims [I think it's more complex than this...]. His extractive
impulse leads him naturally into financial speculation and thus to the urban
centers of California, where he experiences the classic naturalist "plot of
decline" as distance from his wilderness roots takes its toll through the
drinking and inactivity it engenders. London paints a portrait of a typological
figure whose very physical being and essential character transforms as a result
of a change in his environment, and the loss is rendered in terms that are
understood historically as reflecting a change in the fundamental nature of the
species. The only way for Harnish to regain his physical vitality is to abandon
a capitalist conception of land in favor of a respectful engagement with it, an
engagement that is aesthetic at the same time that it is horticultural and
ecological. Rather than extracting value from land in the form of rent, Harnish
begins to value the land itself based on its health and an autonomy that
approximates that of the wild north from which he came. But it is not wildness
itself that he values---rather, it is his relationship with the land,
a relationship that is active without being extractive, encouraging growth that
increases the productive capacity of the land whether or not what is produced
is profitable. In order to attain this state of horticultural enlightenment, he
has to come to an understanding of the influence environment has on his basic
being, or in other words of the naturalist logic of determinism that cuts right
to the genre's conception of humanness itself. When a small landslide in his
new idealized natural environment reveals a strain of gold, he feels himself
momentarily pulled back into the extractive, urban version of the human that he
has fought hard to escape. In an important symbolic moment, he covers the gold
back up, knowingly choosing an atavistic human existence to preserve himself
and his immediate environment in the same act. A dynamic relationship to
species, one that balances determinism of possible futures with a free act of
choice among those futures, is the basis of this environmental praxis.



## Chapter One (London) informal abstract

Broadly speaking, I am investigating the ways species, race, and horticultural
systems collide in Jack London's agricultural novels, especially *The Valley of
the Moon* (1913), and how these coinciding themes prefigure the difficulties of
using the human *species* as a heuristic in the Anthropocene. In *The Valley of
the Moon*, Billy and Saxon flee the city of Oakland and "return to the land" in
an attempt to experience a fundamental humanness---a search that is complicated
and at times supplanted by contradictory perspectives on race. At first, London
seems to present a form of white supremacism, as his protagonists revel in
a shared "Anglo-Saxon" lineage through which they understand their own
experiences and desires. But later, they represent this lineage of conquest and
exploitation as the very thing that has stripped the American landscape of its
vitality and created the separation of town and country that they experience as
a loss of humanity. In order to experience their humanness, they must resist
the same racialized identity through which they previously understood
themselves and learn from the superior human ecology they see in practice on
the immigrant-owned farms of California. Conceiving of possibilities in the
human-nature relationship thus becomes a site of conflict for the very concept
of the human as species in London's eyes, just as it has a century later in
discussions of the Anthropocene.

As the proliferation of alternatives to the term "Anthropocene" demonstrates,
the "Anthropo-" prefix has been as contested in the humanities as the "-cene"
suffix has been in the sciences. "Anthropo-" seems to assign equal culpability
and equal risk to all humans, regardless of how one has benefited from the
fossil fuel economy or how imminently one is endangered by its climatic
outcomes. At the same time, understanding the effects of human activity
geologically seems to require a universalization of humanity, an act that
exceeds the bounds of human experience and the scope of human histories to
date. As Dipesh Chakrabarty puts it, "Species may indeed be the name of
a placeholder for an emergent, new universal history of humans that flashes up
in the moment of the danger that is climate change. But we can never
*understand* this universal. [... C]limate change poses for us a question of
a human collectivity, an us, pointing to a figure of the universal that escapes
our capacity to experience the world" (221-2). London's work is marked by
repeated attempts to narratively access the very experience of species that
Chakrabarty points out is unattainable, whether through animal characters in
his most famous works or through the "Mid-Pleistocene," pre-human primates of
*Before Adam* (1907). Reading London's work for this struggle with the
problematic heuristic of "species experience" can thus lend insight to
contemporary attempts to reconceive of human histories on a geological scale. 

Posing this question in the context of the rest of London's work can also bring
his less-read agricultural novels more closely into the ambit of the rest of
his work, influencing our readings of both as a result. Indeed, these late
agricultural novels can be seen as a new ground on which to explore themes that
defined his life and work more broadly. At the end of his life, Jack London's
dual obsession with species and race was joined by a third obsession, "natural"
living and farming techniques. Living and working on an experimental farm in
the Sonoma Valley, London's writing began to expound the theories on which his
agricultural practice was based, outlining industrial agriculture's
despoliation of the land in contrast to methods that develop the soil's
richness rather than stripping it of its resources. In the background of these
material and literary explorations are contemporaneous works such as Bolton
Hall's *Three Acres and Liberty*, a touchstone of the "back to the land"
movement, and F. H. King's *Farmers of Forty Centuries*, a study of "permanent
agriculture" methods in East Asian nations, that appear to have unified his
thinking about agriculture with his thinking on the human species and
evolutionary theory. Rather than being seen as a departure from his better
known animal novels and travel narratives, this ecological turn in London's
work should be understood as an extension of his long-standing attempts to
account for what Marx would call the human "species-being," or the defining
behavior of a species, and to navigate the contradictory views on race that
define much of his fiction. 


## Before Adam (notes)

*Before Adam* is Jack London's attempt to narrate the species as a meaningful
category---what Chakrabarty points out is today impossible. London's method for
doing so is through an act of speculation. The narrator is a modern man who
experiences through dreams the life of a forebear who is explicitly from
another geological period, the "Mid-Pleistocene". This modern narrator dubs his
forebear "Big-Tooth", and the split perspective that ensues, in which one
figure relates the experiences of another who is essentially absent, allows
these experiences to be put to language in a way that Big-Tooth himself was
unable to, as he and his species ("The Folk") were pre-verbal. London
eventually reveals that Big-Foot was the sole member of The Folk to contribute
to what would eventually become the human species, as the mother of his
children is an estranged member of the "Fire People," the sub-species that
London implies will eventually become human. We understand that even in his own
time, then, Big-Tooth is "an atavism"---a creature somehow out of time, or on
the waning edge of an evolutionary movement---just as we see the beings that
will replace him. We are asked, narratively, to identify with both, for we
share the atavist's narrative perspective while we are told that we are more
closely related to his antagonists. The act of identification London asks us to
make, then, is not identical to that performed by the modern narrator. It is
rather an identification *with process*, an experience of the self that is
premised not on individuals (though individual subjectivities are central to
the narrative effect), but on the positive and negative evolutionary pressures
that have formed the human of the Holocene---and as we now know, of the
Anthropocene.

## Valley of the Moon (notes)

VM is finally a critique of Americanism and its attendant social ecologies---we
might even say racial ecologies, for the final conclusion of the novel on the
intersection of race and ecology is that the Anglo-Saxon "zone conqueror"
frontier myth is the very thing that leads to bonanza farming and strip-mining
of the soil. It is not an Anthropocene but an Anglo-Saxoncene; while Billy
remains deterministically trapped by the desire to expand ever bigger, we
see over and over that Billy and Saxon's dreams are only realized when he
resists those impulses and listens to Saxon's wiser, more ecological,
place-based version of agriculture that she only learns by embracing the
methods and individuals of other cultures, overwriting the very impulses that
they see as defining their Anglo-Saxon identities. The ecological crisis in
miniature, the stripped and abandoned farms of the Sonoma Valley, can only be
resolved by an embrace of a multi-cultural social ecology and a renunciation of
nativism and Billy's working-class racism. (some of this backed up by
Reesman---cite copiously but claim what's my own)

## The Acorn-Planter (play, 1916)

Hard to know whether this is useful/how/how it fits into the whole larger
race/agrarianism thing. Depicts Native Americans as the aggressors, which is
disgusting, but not because of any innate primitivism---rather because of
a political structure in which the war-mongers among them are allowed too much
power. Depicts a "prophecy" of the coming of the "Sun Men" who are
blond-haired, blue-eyed, semi-mythical beings who carry thunder and from whom
verdancy springs naturally... and of course these beings are just white people.
Most alarmingly, co-opts the ham-fisted idea of American Indian mythology as
a justification of white conquest. (Reading this makes me want to stop working
on London, but that's obviously not an option. But I should probably address
this as a way of foregrounding the purpose of my reading, which is to confront
London's racism (and forwarding of racist ideologies) as a way of addressing
the racism implicit in certain kinds of species-talk). 

Here's the silver lining: the play concludes with an imagined alliance, what he
elsewhere calls a "brotherhood of man," between the "planters" among white
settlers and American Indian nations---the idea is that ideological commitments
and a shared agrarian vision would supercede the (totally imaginary rendering
of) racial divisions. Sort of coincides with the multicultural agrarianism that
concludes VM, but also problematizes it---maybe helps me navigate the
particular set of contradictions in that conclusion.




## Engagements with species and the anthropocene

### Wark, Molecular Red

3-4: "Our species-being is as builders of worlds. This is the central
proposition of all of Bogdanov's thought. Let's not concern ourselves just yet
with what the boundaries of the "human" might be. It's a category endlessly
caught up in differences and similarities with the categories of the animal,
the angelic or the machinic. Let's just think of us, for now, as Darwin might,
as a *population*....Bogdanov, who know some Darwin, had more interest in the
life of this species-being than in its definition." 

N156, p251: "Species-being has to be understood here, after Darwin, as
a population, rather than an essence. Marx perhaps never quite outgrew the
pre-scientific notion of species-being he inherited from Feuerbach, but one can
rethink the category of species-being in a non-essential way. See Norman Geras,
Marx and Human Nature, London: Verso, 1985." 

    - a few thoughts here, first of which being Marx's species-being is
dramatically historically contingent and quite un-essentialist. Feuerbach's
seems to be about self-recognition as species, which is essentialist I guess
insofar as he attributes it to all humans...

### One Species, Same Difference? 

Chakrabarty skips poco eco 

Reminder: Chakrabarty: universal "more like a universal that arises from
a shared sense of catastrophe" and "cannot subsume particularities". I note
that London is at his most species-oriented when there is a catastrophe at
hand, be it environmen- tal catastrophe or the extinction of The Folk. 

"Post-colonial ecocriticism has already covered this terrain, acknowledging
the importance of environmental species thinking, even as it reminds us to
treat  such  calls  for  collectivity  with  due  caution." (33)

calls out ch as anthropocentric 

Chakrabarty's version of the species is premised on a shared attempt to become
less vulnerable.

The main claim here, and the topic of the author's critique, seems to be that
species-thinking is defined by a shared commitment to longevity and
reproduction, individually and as a species, in ways that seem to prescribe
this version of the species and of commonality while simultaneously
proscribing any such thinking on behalf of other species. 

Prescribes as a task for poco: interrogate the limits of species thinking while
still dwelling at the intersection of natural science and humanities

### Baucom, Human Shore

"Chakrabarty’s point is not that we should, therefore, abandon the project of
human freedom in the interest of averting a full-blown ecological catastrophe.
It is instead that within the moment of the Anthropocene we need to reconceive
freedom as, also, a struggle to preserve the life of the species and the
conditions under which human life and all other forms of life can flourish on
the planet." (2)

To that end, let me note two key things about this new humanism. The first is
that while it may constitute a universalism, it does not imply an essential-
ism. It is, instead, an epistemologically blended (or hybrid) universalism, one
which takes an empirical concept from the natural sciences (species,
plasticity) and grafts it with a philosophical concept from the humanities
(freedom), to produce what Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno call a “novel as-
semblage”: a novel concept of the human (as species-toward-freedom,
plasticity-toward-freedom) part indebted to natural history and part to
reflective history; or as Malabou very precisely puts it, one that assembles
a concept of the human from a “reasonable materialism,” from a hybrid of the
reasoning sciences (philosophy, the humanities) and the natural sciences of
observation and description (biology, ecology, geology). 21 As such a hybrid
blend, or “novel assemblage,” this “human” is neither essential nor fixed. It
is open matter for a project of political thought.

And, as Chakrabarty’s essay indicates, it is one more thing: a univer-
sal that neither precedes reflection nor a political orientation toward the
future, but one that “arises from a shared sense of catastrophe.” 22 It is an
“emergent, new universal” that “flashes up in the moment of the danger
that is climate change.” 23 If that general formulation indicates that species
thinking ultimately emerges from the need to craft a strategic universalism,
then Chakrabarty’s precise phrasing, his appeal to a concept “flash[ing] up
in a moment of danger,” indicates that the human of this new, alterglobal
humanism (this human of the “concert of the faculties”) is also a specifically
Benjaminian universal, and that this concept of species (or, what we might
more productively think of as “species–being”), may well be regarded as an
analog to what Walter Benjamin calls “jetztzeit,” or “now-being.” (10)

The analogous concept of species–being, I am suggesting, invites us to assert
for the humanities, for postcolonial studies, both a similar and a new
constellating power, one whose key challenge is both to bridge the gap between
what-has-been and what-is and to span the divide between a philosophical and
a natural–scientific conception of the human. (10)

- Yes, and this is a way of framing the anachronistic method that characterizes
my study... use this in the intro, perhaps also in the use of species-being as
a concept

Taken together, Benjamin’s last and Chakrabarty’s four new theses thus invite
us to raise our angle of philosophi- cal and historical inspection to an
entirely different level: to view the scale of the challenge before us from
a second disastrous position in which the angel of history, wings blown
backwards into the heavens, might now find himself, an empyrean realm that has
itself not escaped the crisis of climate change, a heavenly height also subject
to humanity’s capacity to become a devastating, atmospheric, force of nature,
and so to see, from those pol- luted heights, both the catastrophes of recorded
history and the twinned, linked, catastrophes of natural history affecting the
earth’s continents and coastlines. (11)

- oh hai, a *raison* for my entire project, summarily put: 

"If it is to be more than a view from on high, however, it must be more than
that, or, perhaps more accurately, less than that; it must be less distanced,
less empyrean, and less stratospheric. It must abandon the heavens, set feet
back on the ground, and ask, whether, having caught that catastrophic glimpse
from above, we might, as Benjamin also hoped, “blast open the continuum of
history” that has produced this unfolding chain of catastrophes, so that we
might, in Malabou’s terms, render our work truly “plastique,” truly explosive
for the future. 27 If we are to do so, then, I firmly believe, we must return
to our archive, to seek and discover in it (in addition to the concept of
freedom) the further conceptual material that will allow our studies, our
interpretive strategies, and our habits of critique to acquire a new planetary
potentiality, to indeed become a force of nature."

"Rather, in extending the time frame of our self-understanding, in inviting us
to take on the deep historical recognition of our species–being, this form of
thinking and inhabiting the precariousness of life demands, as both Butler and
Chakrabarty have it, that we radically expand our commitment to enhancing the
conditions under which human life might flourish. It demands, as Chakrabarty
more particularly stresses, that we expand our commitment to the conditions
under which not just human life, but life itself, can continue to thrive
through the deep future of the planet. The paradox of that demand, of course,
is that the only way in which we might do so, the only way in which we might
help secure humanity’s capacity to persevere (in its species–being and as one
species among others) deep in time is by abandoning the Hobbesian/ Grotian
political law of self-preservation; by turning ourselves away from the
self-protective love of humanity for itself; by risking the insecurity of life
outside the confines of the classic commonwealth." (18)

## Critical London sources

### Earl on London's evolving agrarian vision

- mine literally every one of these quotes

" "In the solution of the great economic prob- lems of the present age," he
said, "I see a return to the soil. I go into farming because my philosophy and
research have taught me to recog- nize the fact that a return to the soil is
the basis of economics ... I see my farm in terms of the world, and I see the
world in terms of my farm." (qtd. in 99)

"What he envisioned was a universal conversion of swords into plowshares - or,
perhaps more accurately, of military tanks into tractors" (101)
 

### Gair on Citizenship, Capitalism, and Race in VM

"In *TVotM*, then, the journey undertakne by the two protagonists can be viewed
as a way of coming to terms with a history largely denied in the conclusion to
*BD*"---this history includes the displacement of native Americans and, I'd
add, the environmental history of the valley and its soil (419)

- largely misses the critique of Anglo-Saxonism, fails to see the ways in which
Saxon undergoes the enlightenment that Billy fails to---takes the early
statements about "real Americans" as static throughout

- a productive engagement with W.B. Michaels's "Race into Culture: A Critical
Genealogy of Cultural Identity". Basically uses WBM to argue for a combination
of birth and behavior in the assumption of a racialized identity

- I will need to reconcile the embrace of capitalism with the rejection of
growth---or at least the embrace of profitability and market relations.
Ultimately having a capitalism without growth and exploitation is the fantasy
that the novel's conclusion relies upon---it's like reestablishing the dream
that settlers were sold in California before being disenfranchised by the
railroads. 

### Jack London's Racial Lives


London paired stories to switch point of view, as in The Call of the Wild and
White Fang or in Adventure ( 1911 ) and “The Red One” ( 1916 ), in order to
reconsider an idea or value from an opposed point of view, what Lawrence I.
Berkove calls his “second thoughts.” The deeper psychology at play is
particularly obvious in London’s last few stories of 1916 , when his
revisionism especially on race was influenced by his reading of Carl Jung and
his growing awareness of his own relativity and mortality. In these last tales
he brilliantly rethinks earlier ideas about humanity, developing them into
a global sense of human community. (17)


- read "the house of pride" for an allegedly anti-racist story

London’s characters’ anxious relocations of personal and racial identities
among nonwhite Others... London is *worried* about race... (19)

Flora, despite her ambitious intentions for Johnny, helped create psychological
and racial divisions in her son’s sense of identity. As an antidote to her
racism, the di ff erent ideas of racial tolerance he absorbed from the
Prentisses and elsewhere seem to have remained an inner but powerful secret.
Sometimes that awareness was a source of shame and confusion for him, but at
other times, especially later in life, it was a point for him to steer by to
uphold family life as the politics of shared community and imaginative openness
to Others. (28)

- read "When the World Was Young" for another primitivist plot 

- notes London's "racialism" and the influence of theories of race that emerged
out of the natural sciences

But London departs from these Anglo-Saxon definitions in interesting ways.
First, though in the Klondike stories he praises the vigor of the Anglo-Saxon
hero, he also has in mind not just the relatively peaceable settler-farmer of
Anglo-Saxon villages, but the Viking-Norman warrior who overran the
AngloSaxons, the chaotic (not nation-building) “blond beast” of Nietzschean
fantasies, and an image he eventually gave up. It is a common mistake to read
London as a lifelong admirer of Nietzschean Superman heroes, such as the
often-cited Wolf Larsen of The Sea-Wolf ( 1904 ); in this book and nearly all
of London’s works— including notably his most famous short story “To Build
a Fire”—the “lone wolf” hero like Larson perishes. The hero who sticks with his
community of trail-mates survives. Second, London did not see the history of
the Anglo-Saxons as a unique race adventure but as expressing a universal
impulse. (37)

"Undeterred, as a “Distinguished Magazine Writer,” London gave a talk on
December 3 , 1899 , titled “The Expansion Policy” at Union Square Hall in San
Francisco, arguing that “There should be labor and food for all. We invent. We
take advantage of the forces of nature. We enslave the wind and waves. We put
shackles upon the unseen powers.” London argues for the logic of a more
efficient use of the land as the ethic of possession, these high-sounding words
followed by a comparison of slothful and industrious farmers to entire peoples,
and a clearer sense of who “We” might be: 

> A people possess a land.... If they cannot form a stable government, they
cannot guarantee law and order, nor, hence, can they develop the land. Shall
the land lie idle because the people have been false to the terms of their
tacit trust? And shall they reproach the fruitful earth by remaining upon it to
the exclusion of those who could develop it? ... If the original, lazy,
mismanaging owner be at all reasonable, he can take service under his more
strenuous brother. 71 

On the one hand London argues
for a socialist, universalist brotherhood in which there shall be no slaves,
but there is still the “right” of the advanced “brother” to take over the land
from “inefficients.” 72 This glaring philosophical conflict is typical of
London’s early writing." (41-2, quotes from London's talk "The Expansion
Policy" of Dec 3 1899)

- influence for Before Adam: August Weismann *Essays Upon Heredity and Kindred
Biological Problems* (45)

During the Spanish-American War, Jordan argued that “the Anglo-Saxon or any
other civilized race degenerates in the tropics,” a notion that comforted
London when he had to abandon the Snark voyage due to illness. 87 Here Jordan
was influenced by Benjamin Kidd’s The Control of the Tropics ( 1898 ), which
argued that white men could not develop the world’s tropical regions because
they could not be acclimatized to the tropics, and also that the races there
are separated from the white man “by thousands of years of development” and
thus cannot on their own develop their natural resources.(45) 

- this is part of the "scientific" polygenism argument

Haeckel: 

Ernst Haeckel ( 1843 – 1919 ) wrote to London on July 8 , 1907 , thanking him
for his copy of Before Adam . But as early as March 1 , 1900 , London had
written to Johns of Haeckel’s widely circulated idea that ontogeny
recapitulates phylogeny ; that is, the development of an animal embryo traces
the evolutionary history of its species. In History of Creation ( 1876 ) and
The Riddle of the Universe ( 1900 ), Haeckel also claimed that nonwhites were
incapable of inner culture and of higher mental development. 91 He invented
what he called “Monism” to study the world, including animals, human beings,
and society, as an evolutionary whole. London at first found Haeckel
“unassailable” ( Letters , 163 – 67 ) and called himself a Haeckelian “monist”
( Letters , 589 – 90 ), contrasting him to John Fiske ( 1842 – 1901 ),
a Harvard historian and philosopher and friend of Jordan’s who attempted to
fuse Spencer with Christianity.Eventually London rejected both of them. In his
Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy ( 1874 ), like Spencer Fiske proposes the
European ideology of the “Aryan” to organize a universal body of truth obtained
by science. 92 (Speaking of Fiske, Sciambra wryly notes, “None of the
racialists set minor goals for themselves.”) 93 Fiske thought of IndoEuropean
languages as descended from a “single ancestral language” traceable to the
legendary Aryans of the Hindu Vedas . 94 According to Sciambra, Fiske merged
evolution and religion but Haeckel converted evolution into a religion with the
obligatory call to race maintenance. 95 Though London rejected Fiske’s ideas,
he used some of them in forming certain “degenerate” characters (mostly white)
as “atavisms,” such as the dark, hairy antagonist in The Game ( 1905 ) or the
Chau ff eur in The Scarlet Plague . Haeckel traced superficial di ff erences
among the races using hair color and texture instead of Fiske’s phrenology.
This system allowed him to place Polynesians and Asians between whites and
“woolly-head” races, whom he compared to apes. To Fiske asymmetrical features
were also a sign of an inferior race; he believed only the Caucasian attains
complete symmetry in all parts of the body, what Haeckel called “the type of
perfect human beauty.” 96

- on Spencer, 48-50s

- Later in life, London sided with Huxley's largely anti-Spencerian Darwinism
against Spencerian social Darwininism

- Wow, this is Huxley, to whom London turned later in life. Cf Gilman and Ward:
'Huxley most cogently voiced his disagreement with Spencer in “Evolution and
Ethics,” the 1893 Romanes Lecture at Oxford University. Huxley saw nature
unsuitable as a moral guide for humans. Social Darwinism was a “fallacy,” for
social progress really means “a checking of the cosmic process at every step
and the substitution for it of another, which may be called an ethical process;
the end of which is not the survival of those who may happen to be the fittest,
but of those who are ethically the best.” He insists, “Let us understand, once
for all, that the ethical progress of every society depends, not on imitating
the cosmic process [of evolution], still less in running away from it, but in
combating it.” 126 Inspired by Darwin’s “tangled bank” metaphor, Huxley likened
human civilization to a carefully tended garden established in the wilderness,
opposing the “horticultural” to the “cosmic” process, given the garden’s
“artificial conditions of life, better adapted to the cultivated plants than
are the conditions of the state of nature.” There would always be a contest
between the “State of Nature” and the “State of Art of an organized polity,”
and this would continue until the State of Nature eventually prevailed. 127'

- !! I don't think Reesman is thinking of the species as a concept here, but
still interesting: 'Incorporating Darwin’s theories and Huxley’s analysis of
them into his imaginative expression and search for identity, and later falling
under the influence of Jung, London eventually found a creative self who could
finally conceive of “race” as encompassing the entire human race. But it took
his entire career to do so.' (54)

Though Billy Roberts spouts pieties about Americans when he and Saxon encounter
groups of immigrant farmers, The Valley of the Moon in general advances an
idealistic sense of the future through rising in class, as in Martin Eden , but
also in returning to nature, as in Burning Daylight. (245)

- critics seem to largely read VM as sharing the uncomplicated racist views of
its protagonists without noting the ways in which those views collapse

- Not Reesman, who points out: "But to make too sharp a distinction between
these books is to miss the undercurrents of irony in both of them, for they
both contain counterdiscourses to complicate and subvert their surface
themes....In The Valley of the Moon Billy’s discourse is full of racist
anxiety, but this is balanced by Saxon’s gendered sense of cultural
relativity." (245)

feudalism and a continuation of the capitalist system (247)

Who Came Back: Two Twentieth Century Pilgrims Where They Landed" (247)

the racism in American socialism of the moment? )

Saxon identifies with her female forebears’ “hard-working, hard-fighting stock”
( 103 ) but will lead her family to survive because of her ability
imaginatively to “pass” across California’s racial groups who represent
diversity, learning the best from all to construct a new identity as
a California woman. If anything, in The Valley of the Moon , racial mixing
turns out to be life-giving and adaptive, whereas racial purity appears to be
self-destructive. (251)

### Bohemian Grove and the Making of the Bourgeois-Bohemian

(199) London was indeed a member of the Bohemian Club with Frank Norris, and
Comte was also a member!

- but my general sense is that this was a big, bougie club and they may not
have had that much contact... 

### Utility and Beauty should be one...

fascinating but nothing entirely new about the literature or
influences---consult for details of ranch and the thinking/values that went
into it

### Labor Symbolic Wilderness

Four versions:

1. The White Silence --- an unexpected Eden in which people survive by letting
go of fixed habits and adapting to environment; unforgiving but rewards
adaptation

2. Melanesia --- unremittingly cruel and destructive, indifferent to
virtue---kind of a climatic theory of race and humanity here, suggesting that
the cruelty of the jungles turns people into "savages"

3. Polynesia --- Eden itself. A glorification of the place and its people
(though in a primitivist way)

4. The Valley of the Moon. In addition to the eponymous novel, Labor cites
*BD*, *WF*, The Abysmal Brute, and Little Lady of the Big House


### Wolfe, Animal Rites

Or to put it in post-Darwinian rather than poststructuralist terms, the subject
of humanism is constituted by a temporal and evolutionary stratification or
asynchronicity in which supposedly “animalistic” or “primitive” determinations
inherited from our evolutionary past—our boundedness to circadian rhythms, say,
or the various physiological frailties that foreground the body as physically
determined by a fundamentally ahuman universe of interactions ruled by the laws
of physics, chemistry, and genetics—coexist uneasily in a second-order relation
of relations, which the phantasmic “human” surfs or manages with varying
degrees of success or difficulty. (3)



[on Cavell]...our stance toward the animal is an index for how we stand in a field of
otherness and difference generally, and in some ways it is the most reliable
index, the “hardest case” of our readiness to be vulnerable to other knowledges
in our embodiment of our own, an embodiment that arrives at the site of the
other before we do, as our scent reaches the dog's nose before we round the
corner, telling a story we can never wholly script to a present we have not yet
reached. (5)
